  abstract      = {We present a generalization of the classical supervisory control theory for discrete event systems to a setting of dense real-time systems modeled by Alur and Dill timed automata. The main problem involved is that in general the state space of a timed automaton is (uncountably) infinite. The solution is to reduce the dense time transition system to an appropriate finite discrete subautomaton, the grid automaton, which contains enough information to deal with the timed supervisory control problem (TSCP). The plant and the specifications region graphs are sampled for a granularity defined in a way that each state has an outgoing transition labeled with the same time amount. We redefine the controllability concept in the context of grid automata, and we provide necessary and sufficient solvability conditions under which the optimal solution to centralized supervisory control problems in timed discrete event systems under full observation can be obtained. The enhanced setting admits subsystem composition and the concept of forcible event. A simple example illustrates how the new method can be used to solve the TSCP.},
