  abstract      = {The problem studied in this paper is that of distributed controller design for interconnected systems using abstraction-based techniques. Controller synthesis for each subsystem uses local distributed sensor information from other subsystems. Such partial information in an abstraction will be characterized in terms of ranking functions which can be deemed as level sets of Lyapunov functions. An effective procedure is proposed for the computation of ranking functions in the case of reach and stay specifications. A step-by-step algorithmic procedure implementing the proposed approach is presented for controller synthesis based on partial information. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the implementation.},
