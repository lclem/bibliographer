  abstract      = {Control systems are usually modeled by differential equations describing how physical phenomena can be influenced by certain control parameters or inputs. Although these models are very powerful when dealing with physical phenomena, they are less suited to describe software and hardware interfacing with the physical world. For this reason there is a growing interest in describing control systems through symbolic models that are abstract descriptions of the continuous dynamics, where each ``symbol'' corresponds to an ``aggregate'' of states in the continuous model. Since these symbolic models are of the same nature of the models used in computer science to describe software and hardware, they provide a unified language to study problems of control in which software and hardware interact with the physical world. Furthermore, the use of symbolic models enables one to leverage techniques from supervisory control and algorithms from game theory for controller synthesis purposes. In this paper we show that every incrementally globally asymptotically stable nonlinear control system is approximately equivalent (bisimilar) to a symbolic model. The approximation error is a design parameter in the construction of the symbolic model and can be rendered as small as desired. Furthermore, if the state space of the control system is bounded, the obtained symbolic model is finite. For digital control systems, and under the stronger assumption of incremental input-to-state stability, symbolic models can be constructed through a suitable quantization of the inputs.},
