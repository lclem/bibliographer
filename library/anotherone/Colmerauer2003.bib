  abstract      = {We are interested in the expressiveness of constraints represented by general first order formulae, with equality as unique relation symbol and function symbols taken from an infinite set F. The chosen domain is the set of trees whose nodes, in possibly infinite number, are labelled by elements of F. The operation linked to each element f of F is the mapping (a1,..., an) â†¦ b, where b is the tree whose initial node is labelled f and whose sequence of daughters is a1,..., an.},
