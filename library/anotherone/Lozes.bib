  abstract      = {In the modal mu-calculus, a formula is well-formed if each recursive variable occurs underneath an even number of negations. By means of De Morgan's laws, it is easy to transform any well-formed formula into an equivalent formula without negations {\^a} its negation normal form. Moreover, if the formula is of size n, its negation normal form of is of the same size O(n). The full modal mu-calculus and the negation normal form fragment are thus equally expressive and concise.},
