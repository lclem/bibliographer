  abstract      = {We survey the research on application of equivalence checking to formal methods, with a particular focus on the notion of simulation and bisimulation as well as of modal refinement on modal transition systems. We discuss the algorithmic aspects of efficiently computing (bi)simulation relations, the extension to infinite state systems, and existing tool support. We then present results related to simulation and bisimulation checking on timed and hybrid systems and highlight the connections to automata theory.},
