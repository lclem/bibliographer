  abstract      = {We explore the complexity of reachability and run-time refinement under safety and liveness constraints in event-based process models. Our study is framed in the DCR {\$}{\$}^{\backslash}star {\$}{\$} ⋆ process language, which supports modular specification through a compositional operational semantics. DCR {\$}{\$}^{\backslash}star {\$}{\$} ⋆ encompasses the ``Dynamic Condition Response (DCR) graphs'' declarative process model for analysis, execution and safe run-time refinement of process-aware information systems; including replication of sub-processes. We prove that event-reachability and refinement are np-hard for DCR {\$}{\$}^{\backslash}star {\$}{\$} ⋆ processes without replication, and that these finite state processes recognise exactly the languages that are the union of a regular and an {\$}{\$}{\backslash}omega {\$}{\$} $\omega$ -regular language. Moreover, we prove that event-reachability and refinement are undecidable in general for DCR {\$}{\$}^{\backslash}star {\$}{\$} ⋆ processes with replication and local events, and we provide a tractable approximation for refinement. A prototype implementation of the DCR {\$}{\$}^{\backslash}star {\$}{\$} ⋆ language is available at http://dcr.tools/acta16 .},
