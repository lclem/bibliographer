  abstract      = {The main theme of this article is that counting orbits of an infinite permutation group on finite subsets or tuples is very closely related to combinatorial enumeration; this point of view ties together various disparate ``stories''. Among these are reconstruction problems, the relation between connected and arbitrary graphs, the enumeration of N-free posets, and some of the combinatorics of Stirling numbers.},
