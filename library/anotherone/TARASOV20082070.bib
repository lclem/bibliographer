  abstract      = {We address the exact semidefinite programming feasibility problem (SDFP) consisting in checking that intersection of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices and some affine subspace of matrices with rational entries is not empty. SDFP is a convex programming problem and is often considered as tractable since some of its approximate versions can be efficiently solved, e.g. by the ellipsoid algorithm. We prove that SDFP can decide comparison of numbers represented by the arithmetic circuits, i.e. circuits that use standard arithmetical operations as gates. Our reduction may give evidence to the intrinsic difficulty of SDFP (contrary to the common expectations) and clarify the complexity status of the exact SDP---an old open problem in the field of mathematical programming.},
