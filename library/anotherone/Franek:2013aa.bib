  abstract      = {In this paper we consider a fragment of the first-order theory of the real numbers that includes systems of equations of continuous functions in bounded domains, and for which all functions are computable in the sense that it is possible to compute arbitrarily close piece-wise interval approximations. Even though this fragment is undecidable, we prove that there is a (possibly non-terminating) algorithm for checking satisfiability such that (1) whenever it terminates, it computes a correct answer, and (2) it always terminates when the input is robust. A formula is robust, if its satisfiability does not change under small perturbations. As a basic tool for our algorithm we use the notion of degree from the field of (differential) topology.},
