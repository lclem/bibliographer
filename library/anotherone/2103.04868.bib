  abstract      = {There has been a growing interest in defining models of automata enriched with time, such as finite automata extended with clocks (timed automata). In this paper, we study deterministic timed finite state machines (TFSMs), i.e., finite state machines with a single clock, timed guards and timeouts which transduce timed input words into timed output words. We solve the problem of equivalence checking by defining a bisimulation from timed FSMs to untimed ones and viceversa. Moreover, we apply these bisimulation relations to build the intersection of two timed finite state machines by untiming them, intersecting them and transforming back to the timed intersection.},
