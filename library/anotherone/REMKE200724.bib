  abstract      = {We present an in-depth treatment of model checking algorithms for a class of infinite-state continuous-time Markov chains known as quasi-birth death processes. The model class is described in detail, as well as the logic CSL to express properties of interest. Using a new property-independency concept, we provide model checking algorithms for all the CSL operators. Special emphasis is given to the time-bounded until operator for which we present a new and efficient computational procedure named uniformization with representatives. By the use of an application-driven dynamic stopping criterion, the algorithm stops whenever the property to be checked can be certified (or falsified). A comprehensive case study of a connection management system shows the versatility of our new algorithms.},
