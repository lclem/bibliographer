  abstract      = {The existential theory of the reals (ETR) consists of existentially quantified boolean formulas over equalities and inequalities of real-valued polynomials. We propose the approximate existential theory of the reals ( \epsilon \epsilon -ETR), in which the constraints only need to be satisfied approximately. We first show that unconstrained \epsilon \epsilon -ETR = ETR, and then study the \epsilon \epsilon -ETR problem when the solution is constrained to lie in a given convex set. Our main theorem is a sampling theorem, similar to those that have been proved for approximate equilibria in normal form games. It states that if an ETR problem has an exact solution, then it has a k k -uniform approximate solution, where k k depends on various properties of the formula. A consequence of our theorem is that we obtain a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme (QPTAS) for a fragment of constrained \epsilon \epsilon -ETR. We use our theorem to create several new PTAS and QPTAS algorithms for problems from a variety of fields.},
