  abstract      = {The classical Feferman--Vaught Theorem for First Order Logic explains how to compute the truth value of a first order sentence in a generalized product of first order structures by reducing this computation to the computation of truth values of other first order sentences in the factors and evaluation of a monadic second order sentence in the index structure. This technique was later extended by L{\"a}uchli, Shelah and Gurevich to monadic second order logic. The technique has wide applications in decidability and definability theory. Here we give a unified presentation, including some new results, of how to use the Feferman--Vaught Theorem, and some new variations thereof, algorithmically in the case of Monadic Second Order Logic MSOL. We then extend the technique to graph polynomials where the range of the summation of the monomials is definable in MSOL. Here the Feferman--Vaught Theorem for these polynomials generalizes well known splitting theorems for graph polynomials. Again, these can be used algorithmically. Finally, we discuss extensions of \{MSOL\} for which the Feferman--Vaught Theorem holds as well. },
