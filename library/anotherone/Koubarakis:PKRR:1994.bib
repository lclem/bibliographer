  abstract      = {We study the complexity of quantifier elimination and decision in first-order theories of temporal constraints. With the exception of Ladkin, AI researchers have largely ignored this problem. We consider the first-order theories of point and interval constraints over two time structures: the integers and the rational. We show that in all cases quantifier-elimination can be done in PSPACE. We also show that the decision problem for arbitrarily quantified sentences is PSPACE-complete while for ∃k sentences it is ∑pk-complete. Our results must be of interest to researchers working on temporal constraints, computational complexity of logical theories, constraint databases and constraint logic programming.},
