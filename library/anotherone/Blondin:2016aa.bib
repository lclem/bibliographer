  abstract      = {The well-quasi-ordering (i.e., a well-founded quasi-ordering such that all antichains are finite) that defines well-structured transition systems (WSTS) is shown not to be the weakest hypothesis that implies decidability of the coverability problem. We show coverability decidable for monotone transition systems that only require the absence of infinite antichains and call well behaved transitions systems (WBTS) the new strict superclass of the class of WSTS that arises. By contrast, we confirm that boundedness and termination are undecidable for WBTS under the usual hypotheses, and show that stronger monotonicity conditions can enforce decidability. Proofs are similar or even identical to existing proofs but the surprising message is that a hypothesis implicitely assumed minimal for twenty years in the theory of WSTS can meaningfully be relaxed, allowing more orderings to be handled in an abstract way.},
