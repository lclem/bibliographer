  abstract      = {In 2006, Varacca and V\"olzer proved that on finite graphs, \omega-regular large sets coincide with \omega-regular sets of probability 1, by using the existence of positional strategies in the related Banach-Mazur games. Motivated by this result, we try to extend it to other classes of sets by means of various notions of simple strategy introduced in a recent paper of Gr\"adel and Le{\ss}enich. We derive that the existence of a move-counting winning strategy implies that the winning condition has probability~1. In particular, we observe that the above result of Varacca and V\"olzer extends to the \omega S-regular sets introduced by Bojanczyk and Colcombet in 2006. Then, we introduce a generalisation of the classical Banach-Mazur game and in particular, a probabilistic version whose goal is to characterise sets of probability~1 (as classical Banach-Mazur games characterise large sets). We obtain a determinacy result for these games, when the winning set is a countable intersection of open sets.},
