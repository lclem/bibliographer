  abstract      = {A variable-free, equational logic {\$}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}L{\}}\^{}{$\backslash$}times{\$}based on the calculus of relations (a theory of binary relations developed by De Morgan, Peirce, and Schr{\"o}der during the period 1864--1895) is shown to provide an adequate framework for the development of all of mathematics. The expressive and deductive powers of {\$}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}L{\}}\^{}{$\backslash$}times{\$}are equivalent to those of a system of first-order logic with just three variables. Therefore, three-variable first-order logic also provides an adequate framework for mathematics. Finally, it is shown that a variant of {\$}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}L{\}}\^{}{$\backslash$}times{\$}may be viewed as a subsystem of sentential logic. Hence, there are subsystems of sentential logic that are adequate to the task of formalizing mathematics.},
