	Abstract = {Abstract A one-counter automaton is a pushdown automaton with a singleton stack alphabet, where stack emptiness can be tested; it is a real-time automaton if it contains no ε-transitions. We study the computational complexity of the problems of equivalence and regularity (i.e. semantic finiteness) on real-time one-counter automata. The first main result shows \{PSPACE\} -completeness of bisimulation equivalence; this closes the complexity gap between decidability [23] and \{PSPACE\} -hardness [25]. The second main result shows \{NL\} -completeness of language equivalence of deterministic real-time one-counter automata; this improves the known \{PSPACE\} upper bound (indirectly shown by Valiant and Paterson [27]). Finally we prove P -completeness of the problem if a given one-counter automaton is bisimulation equivalent to a finite system, and \{NL\} -completeness of the problem if the language accepted by a given deterministic real-time one-counter automaton is regular.},
