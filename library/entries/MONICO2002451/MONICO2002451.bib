  Abstract      = {Let K be an infinite perfect computable field and let IâŠ†K [ x ] be a zero-dimensional ideal represented by a Gr{\"o}bner basis. We derive a new algorithm for computing the reduced primary decomposition of I using only standard linear algebra and univariate polynomial factorization techniques. In practice, the algorithm generally works in finite fields of large characteristic as well.},
