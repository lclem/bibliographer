  Abstract      = "In a previous note it was shown that if a bound f(i) is placed on the degrees of the elements in some basis of an ideal Ai in the polynomial ring k[ X1, ..., Xn ] over an explicitly given field k, i = 0, 1, 2, ..., then a bound can be (and was) constructed for the length of a strictly ascending chain $A\_0 < A\_1 < \cdots$. This result is now obtained using a strictly finitist argument. A corollary is a finitist version of Hilbert's theorem on ascending chains.",
