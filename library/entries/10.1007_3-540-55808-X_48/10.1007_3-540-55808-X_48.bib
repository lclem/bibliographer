  Abstract      = "A language L is said to have a polynomial density if the function pL.(n)={\textbrokenbar}L∩∑n{\textbrokenbar} of L is bounded by a polynomial. We show that the function pR(n) of a regular language R is O(nk), for some k≥0, if and only if R can be represented as a finite union of the regular expressions of the form xy1*z1 ...yt*zt with a nonnegative integer t≤k+1, where x,y1,z1,..., yt, zt are all strings in ∑*.",
