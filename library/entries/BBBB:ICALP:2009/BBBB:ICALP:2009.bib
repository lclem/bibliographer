  Abstract      = "In this paper, we propose an abstract procedure which, given a timed automaton, produces a language-equivalent deterministic infinite timed tree. We prove that under a certain boundedness condition, the infinite timed tree can be reduced into a classical deterministic timed automaton. The boundedness condition is satisfied by several subclasses of timed automata, some of them were known to be determinizable (event-clock timed automata, automata with integer resets), but some others were not. We prove for instance that strongly non-Zeno timed automata can be determinized. As a corollary of those constructions, we get for those classes the decidability of the universality and of the inclusion problems, and compute their complexities (the inclusion problem is for instance EXPSPACE-complete for strongly non-Zeno timed automata).",
