  Abstract      = "We investigate the impact of spontaneous movement in the complexity of verification problems for an automata-based protocol model of networks with selective broadcast communication. We first consider reachability of an error state and show that parameterized verification is decidable with polynomial complexity. We then move to richer queries and show how the complexity changes when considering properties with negation or cardinality constraints.",
