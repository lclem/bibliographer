  Abstract      = "We introduce FPSOLVE, an implementation of generic algorithms for solving fixpoint equations over semirings. We first illustrate the interest of generic solvers by means of a scenario. We then succinctly describe some of the algorithms implemented in the tool, and provide some implementation details.",
