  Abstract      = "We provide new insights on the determinization and minimization of tree automata using congruences on trees. From this perspective, we study a Brzozowski's style minimization algorithm for tree automata. First, we prove correct this method relying on the following fact: when the automata-based and the language-based congruences coincide, determinizing the automaton yields the minimal one. Such automata-based congruences, in the case of word automata, are defined using pre and post operators. Now we extend these operators to tree automata, a task that is particularly challenging due to the reduced expressive power of deterministic top-down (or equivalently co-deterministic bottom-up) automata. We leverage further our framework to offer an extension of the original result by Brzozowski for word automata.",
