	Abstract = {This brief history summarizes the `supervisory control of discrete-event systems' as it has evolved in the period 1980--2017. Overall, the trend has been from centralized or `monolithic' control to more structured architectures, and from `naive' to symbolic computation. Like any `history' this one represents the perspective of the authors; in consequence some important contributions may have been overlooked or short-changed.},
