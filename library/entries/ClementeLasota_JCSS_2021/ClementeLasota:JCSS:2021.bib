	Abstract = {Timed pushdown automata (tpda) are an expressive formalism combining recursion with a rich logic of timing constraints. We prove that reachability relations of tpda are expressible in linear arithmetic, a rich logic generalising Presburger arithmetic and rational arithmetic. The main technical ingredients are a novel quantifier elimination result for clock constraints (used to simplify the syntax of tpda transitions), the use of clock difference relations to express reachability relations of the fractional clock values, and an application of Parikh's theorem to reconstruct the integral clock values.},
