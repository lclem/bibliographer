  Abstract      = {We introduce weighted automata over infinite words with Muller acceptance condition and we show that their behaviors coincide with the semantics of weighted restricted MSO-sentences. Furthermore, we establish an equivalence property of weighted Muller and weighted B{\"u}chi automata over certain semirings.},
