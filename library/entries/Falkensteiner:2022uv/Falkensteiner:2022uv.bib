  Abstract      = "Given an algebraic ordinary differential equation (AODE), we propose a computational method to determine when a truncated power series can be extended to a formal power series solution. If a certain regularity condition on the given AODE or on the initial values is fulfilled, we compute all of the solutions. Moreover, when the existence is confirmed, we present the algebraic structure of the set of all formal power series solutions.",
