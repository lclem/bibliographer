	Abstract = {Improved algorithms for finding denominators of rational solutions of linear difference andq-difference equations with polynomial coefficients are proposed. The improved efficiency of these algorithms is achieved as a result of a more efficient implementation of the Abramov algorithm (due to the use of the Man and Wright algorithm for calculating the dispersion, which is extended for the case ofq-dispersion) and of the improvement of this algorithm by using an additional procedure for minimizing the degree of the denominator (similar to the Migushov algorithm). The case of difference equations is analyzed in detail, whereasq-difference equations are considered by analogy with the first case. The algorithms described were implemented in Maple V.},
