  Abstract      = "We prove the undecidability of mso on {\ensuremath{\omega}} -words extended with the second-order predicate U1 ( X ) which says that the distance between consecutive positions in a set X ? N is unbounded. This is achieved by showing that adding U1 to mso gives a logic with the same expressive power as mso + U , a logic on {\ensuremath{\omega}} -words with undecidable satisfiability. As a corollary, we prove that mso on {\ensuremath{\omega}} -words becomes undecidable if allowing to quantify over sets of positions that are ultimately periodic, i.e. , sets X such that for some positive integer p , ultimately either both or none of positions x and x + p belong to X",
