  Abstract      = "{In the field of music system programming, the T-calculus is a proposal for combining space modeling and time programming into a single programming feature: spatiotemporal tiled programming. Based on a solid algebraic model, it aims at decomposing every operation on musical objects into the sequence of a synchronization operation that describes how objects are positioned one with respect the other, and a fusion operation that describes how their values are then combined. A first simple version of such a tiled calculus is presented and studied in this paper. 1 Introduction}",
