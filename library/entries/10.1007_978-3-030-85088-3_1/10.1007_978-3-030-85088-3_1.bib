	Abstract = {The notion of synchronized sequence, introduced by Carpi and Maggi in 2002, has turned out to be a very useful tool for investigating the properties of words. Moreover, if sequence is synchronized, then one can use a theorem-prover such as Walnut to ``automatically'' prove many results about it, with little human intervention. In this paper I will prove some of the basic properties of synchronization, and give a number of applications to combinatorics on words.},
