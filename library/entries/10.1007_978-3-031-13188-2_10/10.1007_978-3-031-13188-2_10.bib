  Abstract      = {We present the tool Ranker for complementing B{\"u}chi automata (BAs). Ranker builds on our previous optimizations of rank-based BA complementation and pushes them even further using numerous heuristics to produce even smaller automata. Moreover, it contains novel optimizations of specialized constructions for complementing (i) inherently weak automata and (ii) semi-deterministic automata, all delivered in a robust tool. The optimizations significantly improve the usability of Ranker, as shown in an extensive experimental evaluation with real-world benchmarks, where Ranker produced in the majority of cases a strictly smaller complement than other state-of-the-art tools.},
