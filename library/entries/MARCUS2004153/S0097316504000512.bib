    abstract = {This paper examines the extremal problem of how many 1-entries an n×n 0–1 matrix can have that avoids a certain fixed submatrix P. For any permutation matrix P we prove a linear bound, settling a conjecture of Zoltán Füredi and Péter Hajnal (Discrete Math. 103(1992) 233). Due to the work of Martin Klazar (D. Krob, A.A. Mikhalev, A.V. Mikhalev (Eds.), Formal Power Series and Algebraics Combinatorics, Springer, Berlin, 2000, pp. 250–255), this also settles the conjecture of Stanley and Wilf on the number of n-permutations avoiding a fixed permutation and a related conjecture of Alon and Friedgut (J. Combin Theory Ser A 89(2000) 133).},
