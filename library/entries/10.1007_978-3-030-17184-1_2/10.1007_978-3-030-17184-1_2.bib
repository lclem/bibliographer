	Abstract = {We introduce Meta-F{\$}{\$}^{\{}{\backslash}star {\}}{\$}{\$}, a tactics and metaprogramming framework for the F{\$}{\$}^{\backslash}star {\$}{\$}program verifier. The main novelty of Meta-F{\$}{\$}^{\backslash}star {\$}{\$}is allowing the use of tactics and metaprogramming to discharge assertions not solvable by SMT, or to just simplify them into well-behaved SMT fragments. Plus, Meta-F{\$}{\$}^{\backslash}star {\$}{\$}can be used to generate verified code automatically.},
