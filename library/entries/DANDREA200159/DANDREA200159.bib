	Abstract = {We present formulas for the multivariate resultant as a quotient of two determinants. They extend the classical Macaulay formulas, and involve matrices of considerably smaller size, whose non-zero entries include coefficients of the given polynomials and coefficients of their Bezoutian. These formulas can also be viewed as an explicit computation of the morphisms and the determinant of a resultant complex.},
