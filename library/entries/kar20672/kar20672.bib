  Abstract      = "We consider function fields obtained as towers over the field of rational functions, each extension being by a solution of an algebraic differential equation. On the assumption that an oracle exists for the constants, we present two algorithms for determining whether a given expression is functionally equivalent to zero in such a field. The first, which uses Grobner bases, has the advantage of theoretical simplicity, but is liable to involve unnecessary computations. The second method is designed with a view to eliminating these.",
