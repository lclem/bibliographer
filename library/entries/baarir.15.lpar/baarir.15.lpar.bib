  Abstract      = "We describe a tool that inputs a deterministic $\omega$-automaton with any acceptance condition, and synthesizes an equivalent $\omega$-automaton with another arbitrary acceptance condition and a given number of states, if such an automaton exists. This tool, that relies on a SAT-based encoding of the problem, can be used to provide minimal $\omega$-automata equivalent to given properties, for different acceptance conditions.",
