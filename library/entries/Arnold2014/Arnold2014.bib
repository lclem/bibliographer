  Abstract      = {We show that the separation property fails for the classes $\Sigma$nof the Rabin-Mostowski index hierarchy of alternating automata on infinite trees. This extends our previous result (obtained with Szczepan Hummel) on the failure of the separation property for the class $\Sigma$2 (i.e., for co-B{\"u}chi sets). The non-separation result is also adapted to the analogous classes induced by weak alternating automata.},
