  Abstract      = "We apply the theory of analytic functors to two topics related to theoretical computer science. One is a mathematical foundation of certain syntactic well-quasi-orders and well-orders appearing in graph theory, the theory of term rewriting systems, and proof theory. The other is a new verification of the Lagrange--Good inversion formula using several ideas appearing in semantics of lambda calculi, especially the relation between categorical traces and fixpoint operators.",
