	Abstract = {If an equational class of algebras has the distributive or permutable congruence property then it is well known that it satisfies certain conditions, known as Mal'cev-type conditions. In this note such Mal'cev-type conditions are used to find minimal bases for certain equational theories of algebras. A typical result states that every finitely based equational theory of algebras with distributive and permutable congruences is one-based.},
