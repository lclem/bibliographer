  Abstract      = "In this discussion, a useful theorem applied to the modified z-transform (1,2)2 is introduced and verified. This theorem is fairly general and covers a few special cases that found many applications in the study of pulsed-systems. These mentioned cases are discussed extensively and documented with examples and a short table in the Appendix. Various other cases of the theorem and its extension are pointed out in this paper.",
