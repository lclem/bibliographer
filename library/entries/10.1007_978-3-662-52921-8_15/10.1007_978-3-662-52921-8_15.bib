	Abstract = {We study the class {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}{\backslash}{\\#}AC^0{\}}{\$}{\$}of functions computed by constant-depth polynomial-size arithmetic circuits of unbounded fan-in addition and multiplication gates. No model-theoretic characterization for arithmetic circuit classes is known so far. Inspired by Immerman's characterization of the Boolean class {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}AC^0{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}, we remedy this situation and develop such a characterization of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}{\backslash}{\\#}AC^0{\}}{\$}{\$}. Our characterization can be interpreted as follows: Functions in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}{\backslash}{\\#}AC^0{\}}{\$}{\$}are exactly those functions counting winning strategies in first-order model checking games. A consequence of our results is a new model-theoretic characterization of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}TC{\}}^0{\$}{\$}, the class of languages accepted by constant-depth polynomial-size majority circuits.},
