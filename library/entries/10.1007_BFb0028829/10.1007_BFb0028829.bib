	Abstract = {We give a survey of recent works relating algebraic languages with the combinatorics of ``planar pictures'' (i.e. planar maps, animals, polyominoes, secondary structures,{\ldots}). Such objects are encoded with words. Applications are in enumeration theory, in connection with statistical Physics, molecular Biology, algorithmic complexity and computer graphics drawing.},
