	Abstract = {This paper shows an algorithm to construct the Grobner bases of radicals of zero-dimensional ideals. Computing radicals is equivalent to solving systems of algebraic equations without counting the multiplicities of solutions. We prove that the Grobner basis of a radical zero-dimensional ideal takes a special form after a suitable transformation of coordinates.},
