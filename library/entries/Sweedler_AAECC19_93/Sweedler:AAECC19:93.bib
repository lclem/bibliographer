  Abstract      = "Suppose I is a prime ideal in k[X1, ...,Xn] with a given finite generating set and k(q1,...,qm) is a finitely generated subfield of the field of fractions Z of k[X1, ..., Xn]/I and c is an element of Z. We present Groebner basis techniques to determine:if c is transcendental over k(q1,...,qm),a minimal polynomial for c if c is algebraic over k(q1,...,qm).the algebraic or transcendental nature of Z over k(q1,...,qm).",
