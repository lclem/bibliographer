	Abstract = {A polynomial ideal membership problem is an (n+1)-tuple P = {\textlangle}p, p1, p2,..., pn{\textrangle} where p and the piare multivariate polynomials over some ring, and the problem is to determine whether p is in the ideal generated by the pi. For polynomials over the integers or rationals, it is known that this problem is exponential space hard. Here, we show that the problem for multivariate polynomials over the rationals is solvable in exponential space, establishing its exponential space completeness.},
