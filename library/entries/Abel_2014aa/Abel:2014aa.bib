  Abstract      = "In this paper, we present an Agda formalization of a normalizer for simply-typed lambda terms. The normalizer consists of two coinductively defined functions in the delay monad: One is a standard evaluator of lambda terms to closures, the other a type-directed reifier from values to eta-long beta-normal forms. Their composition, normalization-by-evaluation, is shown to be a total function a posteriori, using a standard logical-relations argument.",
