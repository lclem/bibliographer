	Abstract = {In this paper we define and discuss the generalized inverse and Moore-Penrose inverse for Ore polynomial matrices. Based on GCD computations and Leverrier-Faddeeva method, some fast algorithms for computing these inverses are constructed, and the corresponding Maple package including quaternion case is developed.},
