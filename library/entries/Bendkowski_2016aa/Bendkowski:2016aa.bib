  Abstract      = "A natural approach to software quality assurance consists in writing unit tests securing programmer-declared code invariants. Throughout the literature a great body of work has been devoted to tools and techniques automating this labour-intensive process. A prominent example is the successful use of randomness, in particular random typeable",
