	Abstract = {For any sentence$\alpha$ (in sentential logic) letd$\alpha$ be the delay complexity of the boolean functionf$\alpha$ represented by$\alpha$. We prove that for infinitely manyd (and starting with somed<620) there exist valid implications$\alpha${\textrightarrow}$\beta$ withd$\alpha$,d$\beta$â‰¦d such that any Craig's interpolantx has its delay complexityd$\chi$ greater thand+(1/3){\textperiodcentered}log(d/2). This is the first (non-trivial) known lower bound on the complexity of Craig's interpolants in sentential logic, whose general study may well have an impact on the central problems of computation theory.},
