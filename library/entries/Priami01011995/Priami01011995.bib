  Abstract      = "We extend the π-calculus, a model of concurrent processes based on the notion of naming, to cope with performance modelling. The new language is called the stochastic π-calculus (Sπ). We obtain a more expressive language than classical stochastic process algebras because Sπ is given in the classical structural operational approach. In order to effectively computer performance measures, we define a stratified transition system that is finitely branching. We give a transition rule to directly yield a continuous time Markov chain from an Sπ specification, with no transition system manipulation.",
