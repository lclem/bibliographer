  Abstract      = "The technique of relaxed power series expansion provides an efficient way to solve so called recursive equations of the form {\$}{\$}F = {$\backslash$}varPhi (F){\$}{\$}, where the unknown F is a vector of power series, and where the solution can be obtained as the limit of the sequence {\$}{\$}0, {$\backslash$}varPhi (0), {$\backslash$}varPhi ({$\backslash$}varPhi (0)), {$\backslash$}ldots {\$}{\$}. With respect to other techniques, such as Newton's method, two major advantages are its generality and the fact that it takes advantage of possible sparseness of {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}varPhi {\$}{\$}. In this paper, we consider more general implicit equations of the form {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}varPhi (F) = 0{\$}{\$}. Under mild assumptions on such an equation, we will show that it can be rewritten as a recursive equation.",
