	Abstract = {The long run behaviour of linear dynamical systems is often studied by looking at eventual properties of matrices and recurrences that underlie the system. A basic problem in this setting is as follows: given a set of pairs of rational weights and matrices {\$}{\$}{\backslash}{\{}(w{\\_}1, A{\\_}1), {\backslash}ldots , (w{\\_}m, A{\\_}m){\backslash}{\}}{\$}{\$}{\{}(w1,A1),{\ldots},(wm,Am){\}}, does there exist an integer N s.t for all {\$}{\$}n {\backslash}ge N{\$}{\$}n≥N, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sum {\\_}{\{}i=1{\}}^m w{\\_}i{\backslash}cdot A{\\_}i^n {\backslash}ge 0{\$}{\$}∑i=1mwi{\textperiodcentered}Ain≥0(resp. {\$}{\$}> 0{\$}{\$}>0). We study this problem, its applications and its connections to linear recurrence sequences. Our first result is that for {\$}{\$}m{\backslash}ge 2{\$}{\$}m≥2, the problem is as hard as the ultimate positivity of linear recurrences, a long standing open question (known to be {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}coNP{\}}{\$}{\$}coNP-hard). Our second result is that for any {\$}{\$}m{\backslash}ge 1{\$}{\$}m≥1, the problem reduces to ultimate positivity of linear recurrences. This yields upper bounds for several subclasses of matrices by exploiting known results on linear recurrence sequences. Our third result is a general reduction technique for a large class of problems (including the above) from diagonalizable case to the case where the matrices are simple (have non-repeated eigenvalues). This immediately gives a decision procedure for our problem for diagonalizable matrices.},
