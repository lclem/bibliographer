  Abstract      = "The notion of two-way automata was introduced at the very beginning of automata theory. In 1959, Rabin and Scott and, independently, Shepherdson, proved that these models, both in the deterministic and in the nondeterministic versions, have the same power of one-way automata, namely, they characterize the class of regular languages.",
