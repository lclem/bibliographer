  Abstract      = "In a former paper, we defined a new semantics for timed automata, the Almost ASAP semantics, which is parameterized by $\Delta$ to cope with the reaction delay of the controller. We showed that this semantics is implementable provided there exists a strictly positive value for the parameter $\Delta$ for which the strategy is correct. In this paper, we define the implementability problem to be the question of existence of such a $\Delta$. We show that this question is closely related to a notion of robustness for timed automata defined in [Pur98] and prove that the implementability problem is decidable.",
