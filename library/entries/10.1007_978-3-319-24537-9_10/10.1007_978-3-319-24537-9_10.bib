	Abstract = {We study pushdown vector addition systems, which are synchronized products of pushdown automata with vector addition systems. The question of the boundedness of the reachability set for this model can be refined into two decision problems that ask if infinitely many counter values or stack configurations are reachable, respectively. Counter boundedness seems to be the more intricate problem. We show decidability in exponential time for one-dimensional systems. The proof is via a small witness property derived from an analysis of derivation trees of grammar-controlled vector addition systems.},
