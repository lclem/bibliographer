	Abstract = {Hybrid automata have been introduced in both control engineering and computer science as a formal model for the dynamics of hybrid discrete-continuous systems. While computability issues concerning safety properties have been extensively studied, liveness properties have remained largely uninvestigated. In this article, we investigate decidability of state recurrence and of progress properties.},
