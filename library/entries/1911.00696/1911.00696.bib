  Abstract      = "We show that the consistency problem for Statistical EL ontologies, defined by Pe{\\textasciitilde {n}}aloza and Potyka, is ExpTime-hard. Together with existing ExpTime upper bounds, we conclude ExpTime-completeness of the logic. Our proof goes via a reduction from the consistency problem for EL extended with negation of atomic concepts.",
