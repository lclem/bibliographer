	Abstract = {We describe the close relationship between permutation groups and combinatorial species (introduced by A. Joyal, Adv. in Math. 42, 1981, 1--82). There is a bijection Φ between the set of transitive actions (up to isomorphism) of Sn on finite sets and the set of ``molecular'' species of degree n (up to isomorphism). This bijection extends to a ring isomorphism between B(Sn) (the Burnside ring of the symmetric group) and the ring V Sn (of virtual species of degree n).Since permutation groups are well known (and often studied using computers) this helps in finding examples and counterexamples in species. The cycle index series of a molecular species, which is hard to compute directly, is proved to be simply the (P{\'o}lya) cycle polynomial of the corresponding permutation group. Conversely, several operations which are hard to define in ΠnB(Sn) have a natural description in terms of species. Both situations are extended to coefficients in λ-rings and binomial rings in the last section.},
