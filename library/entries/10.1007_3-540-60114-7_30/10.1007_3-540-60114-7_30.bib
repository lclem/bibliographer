	Abstract = {In order to be able to manipulate solutions of systems of differential equations, one usually constructs differential extensions of differential rings, but the effectivity of the equality test in the extension is not trivial. In the ordinary differential case, the problem has been solved (see [13] and [3]). We propose here a method in the case of extensions obtained by adjunction of formal power series defined as solutions of a system of non linear PDE's associated with a finite set of initial conditions.},
