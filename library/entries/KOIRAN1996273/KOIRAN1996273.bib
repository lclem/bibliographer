  Abstract      = "We show that if the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis is true, the problem of deciding whether a system of polynomial equations in several complex variables has a solution is in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy (in fact, this problem is in RPNP). The best previous bound was PSPACE.",
