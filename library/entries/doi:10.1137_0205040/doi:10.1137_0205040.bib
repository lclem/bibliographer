	Abstract = {The parallel arithmetic complexities of matrix inversion, solving systems of linear equations, computing determinants and computing the characteristic polynomial of a matrix are shown to have the same growth rate. Algorithms are given that compute these problems in \$O(\log ^2 n)\$ steps using a number of processors polynomial in n. (n is the order of the matrix of the problem.)},
