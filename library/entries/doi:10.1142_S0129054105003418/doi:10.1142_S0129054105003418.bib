	Abstract = {In this paper, we study the tradeoffs in descriptional complexity of NFA (nondeterministic finite automata) of various amounts of ambiguity. We say that two classes of NFA are separated if one class can be exponentially more succinct in descriptional sizes than the other. New results are given for separating DFA (deterministic finite automata) from UFA (unambiguous finite automata), UFA from MDFA (DFA with multiple initial states) and UFA from FNA (finitely ambiguous NFA). We present a family of regular languages that we conjecture to be a good candidate for separating FNA from LNA (linearly ambiguous NFA).},
