  Abstract      = "Abstract This note provides an elementary and simpler proof of the Nikaid{\^o}-Sion version of the von Neumann minimax theorem accessible to undergraduate students. The key ingredient is an alternative for quasiconvex/concave functions based on the separation of closed convex sets in finite dimension, a result discussed in a first course in optimization or game theory.",
