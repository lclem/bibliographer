  Abstract      = "We generalize the concept of tree-width to directed graphs and prove that every directed graph with no ``haven'' of large order has small tree-width. Conversely, a digraph with a large haven has large tree-width. We also show that the Hamilton cycle problem and other NP-hard problems can be solved in polynomial time when restricted to digraphs of bounded tree-width.",
