  Abstract      = "Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the Hamilton's Quaternions. Hamilton's original motivation was to find an algebraic formalism for the points (x1, x2, x3) in 3-space, in generalization of the formalism of the complex numbers C as pairs of real numbers. A matrix model of the quaternion algebra H is discussed. In modern algebra, a division ring is a ring K with identity 1 â‰  0 in which every nonzero element is an inverse. These rings are the most ``perfect'' algebraic systems: as one can add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Most of the applications of quaternions to physics are applications of biquaternions. Several other important mathematical developments----namely, Cayley Algebra, Frobenius' Theorem, and Vector Analysis are also described. The fundamental theorem of algebra says that C is an algebraically closed field; that is, any non-constant polynomial in C[x] has a zero in C. The main point of passing from R to C is exactly to get an ``algebraic closure'' of the reals. The features of the quaternions are the role they play in the understanding and representation of the rotations of the low-dimensional Euclidean spaces.",
