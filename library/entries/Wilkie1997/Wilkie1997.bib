	Abstract = {In [5] I showed that the theory of the real exponential field, i.e. the theory T exp of the structure R exp := {\textlangle}R; +, {\textperiodcentered}, -, 0, 1, exp, <{\textrangle} is model complete. Subsequently, in the paper[4], Macintyre and I settled, conditionally, an old question of Tarski concerning the decidability of Texp. We showed that if a certain famous conjecture from transcendental number theory, namely Schanuel's conjecture, is true then T exp is, indeed, a decidable theory and in this lecture I am happy to comply with the organizers' suggestion that I explain precisely the r{\^o}le played by this conjecture in the verification of the algorithm.},
