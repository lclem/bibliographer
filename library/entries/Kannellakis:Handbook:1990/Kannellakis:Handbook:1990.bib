	Abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents a systematic and unifying introduction to relational database theory, including some of the recent developments in database logic programming. The chapter focuses on the two basic components of the relational data model: its specification component, which is the database scheme with dependencies; and its operational component, which is the relational algebra query language. The choice of basic constructs, for specifying the semantically meaningful databases and for querying them, is justified through an in-depth investigation of their properties. Some important research themes are also reviewed in the chapter: the analysis of the hypergraph syntax of a database scheme, and the extensions of the query language using deduction or universal relation assumptions. The chapter discusses two fundamental concepts, namely, dependencies and queries. The main themes of dependency theory are implication problems and applications to database scheme design. Queries are classified in a various ways, with emphasis on the connections between the expressibility of query languages, finite model theory, and logic programming.},
