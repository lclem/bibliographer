	Abstract = {We give a {\\#}NC1 upper bound for the problem of counting accepting paths in any fixed visibly pushdown automaton. Our algorithm involves a non-trivial adaptation of the arithmetic formula evaluation algorithm of Buss, Cook, Gupta and Ramachandran (SIAM J. Comput. 21:755--780, 1992). We also show that the problem is {\\#}NC1 hard. Our results show that the difference between {\\#}BWBP and {\\#}NC1 is captured exactly by the addition of a visible stack to a nondeterministic finite-state automaton.},
