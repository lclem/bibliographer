	Abstract = {This paper focuses on polynomial dynamical systems over finite fields. These systems appear in a variety of contexts, in computer science, engineering, and computational biology, for instance as models of intracellular biochemical networks. It is shown that several problems relating to their structure and dynamics, as well as control theory, can be formulated and solved in the language of algebraic geometry.},
