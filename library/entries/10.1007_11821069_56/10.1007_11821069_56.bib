	Abstract = {The fastest known algorithm for checking bisimulation equivalence of normed context-free processes worked in O(n13) time. We give an alternative algorithm working in {\$}O(n^8 {\{}{\backslash}sl polylog{\}} n){\$}time, As a side effect we improve the best known upper bound for testing equivalence of simple context-free grammars from {\$}O(n^7 {\{}{\backslash}sl polylog{\}} n){\$}to {\$}O(n^6 {\{}{\backslash}sl polylog{\}} n){\$}.},
