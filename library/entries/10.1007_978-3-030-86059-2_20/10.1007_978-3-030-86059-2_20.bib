  Abstract      = "We show how to construct uniform interpolants in the context of the modal mu-calculus. D'Agostino and Hollenberg (2000) were the first to prove that this logic has the uniform interpolation property, employing a combination of semantic and syntactic methods. This article outlines a purely proof-theoretic approach to the problem based on insights from the cyclic proof theory of mu-calculus. We argue the approach has the potential to lend itself to other temporal and fixed point logics.",
