  Abstract      = "The truth-values of two renowned conjectures about NP (namely, p NP and, NP is not closed under complementation) depend on the difficulty in writing down Craig's interpolants in sentential logic. The general connection between NP and interpolation is studied by blending ideas and techniques from both model theory and computation theory.",
