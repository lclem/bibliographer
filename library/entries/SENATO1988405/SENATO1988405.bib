  Abstract      = "Publisher Summary The chapter presents a study of polynomial species and connections among bases of the symmetric polynomials by the theory of polynomial species that gives a systematic approach. Using the theory of polynomial species, this chapter proves with bijective arguments, some identities that occur among the classical bases of symmetric polynomials of degree n. The language is that of categories theory and this emphasizes the generality degree of the concept of species.",
