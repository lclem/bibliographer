  Abstract      = "We consider synchronizing properties of Markov decision processes (MDP), viewed as generators of sequences of probability distributions over states. A probability distribution is p-synchronizing if the probability mass is at least p in some state, and a sequence of probability distributions is weakly p-synchronizing, or strongly p-synchronizing if respectively infinitely many, or all but finitely many distributions in the sequence are p-synchronizing.",
