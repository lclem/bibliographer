  Abstract      = "Priced timed (game) automata extend timed (game) automata with costs on both locations and transitions. In this paper we focus on reachability priced timed game automata and prove that the optimal cost for winning such a game is computable under conditions concerning the non-zenoness of cost. Under stronger conditions (strictness of constraints) we prove that in case an optimal strategy exists, we can compute a state-based winning optimal strategy.",
