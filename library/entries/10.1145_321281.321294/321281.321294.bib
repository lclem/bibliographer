  abstract = {Several devices with two input lines and one output line are introduced. These devices are viewed as transformations which operate on pairs of (ALGOL-like) languages. Among the results proved are the following: (i) a pair consisting of a language and a regular set is transformed into a language; (ii) let (V, W) be a pair consisting of a language and a regular set. Then the set of those words w1, for which there exists a word w2 in V so that (w1, w2) is mapped into W, is a language.},
