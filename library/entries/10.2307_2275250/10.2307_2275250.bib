  Abstract      = "LK is a natural modification of Gentzen sequent calculus for propositional logic with connectives ¬ and $\bigwedge, \bigvee$ (both of bounded arity). Then for every d ≥ 0 and n ≥ 2, there is a set Td n of depth d sequents of total size O(n3 + d) which are refutable in LK by depth d + 1 proof of size exp(O(log2 n)) but such that every depth d refutation must have the size at least exp(nΩ(1)). The sets Td n express a weaker form of the pigeonhole principle.",
