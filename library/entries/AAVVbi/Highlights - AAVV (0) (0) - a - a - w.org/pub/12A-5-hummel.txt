 We propose an operation on languages of infinite trees that significantly increases topological complexity but preserves unambiguity.
 We prove that iterating the operation yields topologically harder and harder sets. 
 As an illustration, we might note that application of the operation to the empty language already produces a non-Borel set, and the next application of the operation produces a set that is outside the sigma-field generated by analytic sets.
 Moreover, we show how to perform a limit step of the iteration.
