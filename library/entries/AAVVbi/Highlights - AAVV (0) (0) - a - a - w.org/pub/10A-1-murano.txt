In multi-agent games, a recent contribution is given by Strategy Logic (SL), 
a powerful formalism that allows to reason explicitly about strategies as first order objects. 
The price to pay for the high expressiveness of SL is that it admits non-behavioral strategies, 
i.e., a choice of an agent in a play may depend on choices made in another counterfactual play. 
As the latter moves are unpredictable, these strategies cannot be synthesized in practice.

In this talk, we introduce two maximal syntactical fragments of SL admitting behavioral strategies only. 
As a consequence, we show that the model-checking problem for both fragments is solvable in 2EXPTIME, 
as it is for the subsumed ATL*.
