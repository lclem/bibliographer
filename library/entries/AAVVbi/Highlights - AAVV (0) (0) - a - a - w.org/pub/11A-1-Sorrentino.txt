In this paper, we make a general study of the concept of promptness in parity
games that allows to put under a unique theoretical framework several of the
cited variants along with new ones.
Also, we describe simple polynomial reductions from all these conditions to
either Buchi or parity games, which simplify all previous known procedures.
