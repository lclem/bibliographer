We discuss the separation problem for regular
  languages. We give a Ptime algorithm to check whether two
  given regular languages are separable by a piecewise testable
  language, that is, whether a $\mathcal{B}\Sigma_1(<)$ sentence can
  witness that the languages are disjoint. If this
  is possible, we express a separator by saturating one of the
  original languages by a suitable congruence. Following the same line,
  we show that one can also decide whether two regular languages can
  be separated by an unambiguous (i.e. $FO^2(<)$-definable) language, albeit with a higher
  complexity.
