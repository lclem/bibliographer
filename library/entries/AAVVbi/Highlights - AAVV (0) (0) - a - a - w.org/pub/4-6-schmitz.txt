Decision problems with a non-elementary complexity occur naturally in
logic, combinatorics, formal language, verification, etc., with
complexities ranging from simple towers of exponentials to
Ackermannian and beyond.  Somewhat surprisingly, we lack the
definitions of classes and reductions that would allow to state
completeness results at such high complexities.  We introduce a
hierarchy of fast-growing complexity classes and discuss its
suitability for completeness statements of non-elementary problems.
