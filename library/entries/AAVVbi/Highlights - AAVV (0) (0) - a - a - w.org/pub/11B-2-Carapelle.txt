CTL* formulas can be enriched to express relations between variables whose value can range in a chosen
concrete domain. 
Chosen the appropriate domain one can express quantitative properties that ordinary CTL^* formulas
can only approximate through abstraction. We can refer directly to concrete values and describe how they 
change in time. 
In this talk we show that satisfiability for CTL* with equality-, order-, and modulo-
constraints over the Z is decidable
