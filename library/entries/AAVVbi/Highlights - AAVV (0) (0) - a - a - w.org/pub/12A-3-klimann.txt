A Mealy automaton is a deterministic, complete, letter-by-letter
transducer, with same input and output alphabet. We can consider the
semigroup generated by the functions on words induced by its states.
We prove that semigroups generated by reversible two-state Mealy
automata have remarkable growth properties: they are either finite or
free. We give an effective procedure to decide finiteness or freeness
of such semigroups when the generating automaton is also invertible.
