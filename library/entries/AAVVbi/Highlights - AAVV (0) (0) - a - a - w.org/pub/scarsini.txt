Although mixed extensions of ﬁnite games always admit equilibria, this
is not the case for countable games, the best-known example being Wald’s
pick-the-larger-integer game. Several authors have provided conditions for the
existence of equilibria in inﬁnite games. These conditions are
typically of topological nature and are not applicable to countable
games. Here we establish
an existence result for the equilibrium of countable games when the strategy
sets are a countable group and the payoﬀs are functions of the group operation.
In order to obtain the existence of equilibria, ﬁnitely additive mixed
strategies
have to be allowed. This creates a problem of selection of a product measure of
mixed strategies. We propose a family of such selections and prove existence of
an equilibrium that does not depend on the selection. As a byproduct we show
that if ﬁnitely additive mixed strategies are allowed, then Wald’s game admits
an equilibrium.
