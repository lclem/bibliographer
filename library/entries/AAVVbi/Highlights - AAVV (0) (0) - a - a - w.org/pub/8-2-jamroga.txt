A well-known result states that every strategic game generates a playable effectivity function, and every playable effectivity function can be implemented with a strategic game. We show that the latter does not hold for infinite games. We identify the error in the proof, and present examples of playable effectivity functions for which no equivalent strategic game exists. Then, we characterize the class of *truly playable* functions that do correspond to strategic games. We also show that Coalition Logic cannot distinguish between the two classes, and we extend it to a logic that is expressive enough.
