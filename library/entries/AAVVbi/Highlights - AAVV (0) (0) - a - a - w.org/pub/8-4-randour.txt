We consider two-player games with mean-payoff (MP) and total-payoff (TP) objectives. In single dimension, their complexities coincide. In multi dimensions, MP games are coNP-complete. We show that TP games are undecidable. We introduce conservative approximations, considering the payoff over a local finite window sliding along a play. For single dimension, we show that (i) if the window is polynomial, deciding the winner is in P, and (ii) the existence of a bounded window can be decided in NP $\cap$ coNP, and is at least as hard as solving MP games. For multi dimensions, we show that (i) the fixed window size problem is EXP-complete, and (ii) there is no primitive-recursive algorithm to decide the existence of a bounded window.
