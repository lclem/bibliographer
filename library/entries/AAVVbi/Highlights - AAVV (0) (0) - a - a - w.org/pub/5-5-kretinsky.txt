We provide the first assume-guarantee reasoning for stochastic continuous-time systems. Interactive Markov chains (IMC) are compositional behavioural models similar to continuous-time Markov decision processes. Given a time-bounded property and an IMC component, we synthesize its scheduler optimizing the probability that the property is satisfied when the IMC is working in an unknown environment. We also give a specification formalism for IMC and consider unknown environments satisfying a given specification.
