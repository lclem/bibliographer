We provide the first assume-guarantee reasoning for stochastic continuous-time systems. Interactive Markov chains (IMC) are compositional behavioural models similar to continuous-time Markov decision processes. Given a time-bounded property, an IMC component and a specification of the environment, we synthesize a scheduler optimizing the probability that the property is satisfied when the IMC is working in an unknown environment that satisfies the specification. In this talk we focus on a two-player continuous-time stochastic game model that we call controller-environment games that is the crucial step in the solution of the problem above.
