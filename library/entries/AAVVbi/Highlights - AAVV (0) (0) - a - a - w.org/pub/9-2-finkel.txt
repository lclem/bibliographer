We prove that the determinacy of Gale-Stewart games whose winning sets are accepted by real-time 1-counter Büchi automata is equivalent 
to the determinacy of (effective) analytic Gale-Stewart games which is known to be a large cardinal assumption. 
Using some results of set theory we prove that one can effectively construct a 1-counter Büchi automaton A  such that: 
(1) There exists a model of ZFC in which Player 1 has a winning strategy in the Gale-Stewart  game G(L(A)); 
but the winning strategies cannot be recursive and not even hyperarithmetical. 
(2) There exists a model of ZFC in which the Gale-Stewart  game is not determined.
