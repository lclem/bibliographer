ATLsc is a powerful formalism for reasoning about multi-agent systems; it is a
natural variant of the semantics of the logic ATL, as defined by Alur,
Henzinger and Kupferman. Using a translation into QCTL (CTL extended with
quantification over atomic propositions), we prove that ATLsc satisfiability
is decidable when satisfiability is restricted to turn-based games, or when
the set of moves allowed to the players in advance. On the other hand, when
strategy quantification is restricted to memoryless strategies, satisfiability
is undecidable in all considered cases.
