Automatic structures are relational structures whose domain can be
presented as a regular language and predicates as synchronously
regular relations.  The main result on automatic structures is an
explicit algorithm to build an automaton that accepts any
first-order relation, relying on the correspondance between logical
connectives and classical operations over automata.

In general, building this automaton is non-elementary, but for some
automatic structures with elementary first-order theory, we show that
this construction has a complexity close to that of the logic.
