Some applications of linear temporal logic (LTL) require to translate
formulae of the logic to deterministic omega-automata. There are currently
two translators producing deterministic automata: ltl2dstar working for the
whole LTL and Rabinizer applicable to LTL(F,G) which is the LTL fragment
using only modalities F and G.  We present a new translation to
deterministic Rabin automata via alternating automata and deterministic
transition-based generalized Rabin automata. Our translation applies to a
fragment that is strictly larger than LTL(F,G). Experimental results show
that our algorithm can produce significantly smaller automata compared to
Rabinizer and ltl2dstar, especially for more complex LTL formulae.
