We study queries on graphs (and other relational structures) defined
by families of Boolean circuits that are invariant under permutations of
the vertices.  In particular, we study circuits that are symmetric,
that is, circuits whose invariance is explicitly witnessed by
automorphisms of the circuit induced by the permutation of their
inputs.  We show a close connection between queries defined on
structures by uniform families of symmetric circuits and definability
in fixed-point logics.
