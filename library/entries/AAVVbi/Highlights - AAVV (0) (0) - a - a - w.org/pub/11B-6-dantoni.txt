One challenge in making online education more effective is to develop automatic grading software that can provide meaningful feedback. This paper provides a solution to automatic grading of the standard computation-theory problem that asks a student to construct a deterministic finite automaton from the given description of its language. We focus on how to assign partial grades for incorrect answers. We experimentally show that the tool is able to assign partial grades in a meaningful way, and should be preferred over the human graders for both scalability and consistency.
