Expressiveness modulo bisimilarity: a coalgebraic perspective

Yde Venema

Janin and Walukiewicz showed that the modal mu-calculus MC is the 
bisimulation-invariant fragment of monadic second-order logic MSO. 
Their proof uses parity automata with a transition map defined in 
terms of monadic first-order logic. We decompose their proof in
three parts:
(1) automata-theoretic characterizations of MSO and MC respectively,
(2) a simple model-theoretic characterization of the identity-free
fragment of monadic first-order logic, and
(3) a coalgebraic result, stating that the second result propagates 
from the `one-step level' to the level of full fixpoint logics.
