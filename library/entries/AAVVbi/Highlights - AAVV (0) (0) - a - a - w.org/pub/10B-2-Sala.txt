We study the effects of the addition of an equivalence relation to one of the most representative 
interval temporal logics, namely, the logic ABBbar of Allen's relations "meets", "begun by", and "begins".
We first prove that the satisfiability problem for the resulting logic ABBbar-sim remains decidable 
over finite linear orders, but it becomes nonprimitive recursive, while decidability is lost over $\bbN$.
Then, we show that ABBbar-sim is expressive enough to define $\omega{S}$-regular languages.
