We study the problem of generalizing from a finite sample to a language taken from a predefined language class. The two language classes we consider are generated by restricted regular expressions (CHAREs and SOREs) that have significance in the specification of XML documents.

For each of the two language classes we give an efficient algorithm returning a minimal generalization from the given finite sample to an element of the fixed language class; such generalizations are called descriptive. In this sense, both our algorithms are optimal.
