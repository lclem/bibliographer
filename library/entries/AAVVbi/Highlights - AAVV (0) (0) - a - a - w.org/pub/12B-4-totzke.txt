One-counter nets (OCN) are Petri nets with exactly one unbounded place.
They are equivalent to a subclass of one-counter automata with only a
weak test for zero. 

We show that weak simulation preorder is decidable for OCN. In contrast,
other semantic relations like weak bisimulation are undecidable for OCN,
and so are weak (and strong) trace inclusion.
