Game bisimulations between basic positions

Yde Venema

Acceptance games and evaluation games provide examples of parity games
in which some positions can be singled out as being *basic*, in the sense
that (1) matches proceed in *rounds*, moving from one basic position to 
another, and (2) when determining the winner of an infinite match, only 
the basic positions matter.

We introduce a notion of bisimulation between two such games that 
combines Pauly's bisimulation between extensive strategic games, with a 
combinatorial part for the parity condition.

Applications include the proof of complementation lemmas in automata
theory.
