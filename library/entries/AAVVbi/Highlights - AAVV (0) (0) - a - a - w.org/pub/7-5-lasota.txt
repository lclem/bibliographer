title: A machine-independent characterization of timed languages

abstract:
We use a variant of sets with atoms (known also as nominal sets) as a framework suitable 
for stating and proving the following two results on timed automata. The first result 
is a machine-independent characterization of languages of deterministic timed automata,
a la Myhill-Nerode Theorem. As our second result we define a class of automata
that slightly extends timed automata and is effectively closed under minimization.
