We consider parity games on infinite graphs where configurations are represented by control-states and integer vectors.  This framework subsumes two classic game problems: parity games on Vector Addition Systems with States (VASS) and multidimensional energy parity games. We show that the multidimensional energy parity game problem is inter-reducible with a subclass of single-sided parity games on VASS where just one player can modify the integer counters and the opponent can only change control-states. Our main result is that the minimal elements of the upward-closed winning set of these single-sided parity games on VASS are computable.
