The premise of this talk is that in order to obtain realistic decision plans for Markov Decision Processes (or other decision-theoretic models) it is useful to consider solution concepts that are as discriminating as possible, by exploiting as much as possible the information provided in the model.
Hence, we propose novel solution concepts for MDPs, obtained by lexicographically composing different risk attitudes, ranging from absolutely risk-averse, or pessimistic, to risk-seeking, or optimistic, in an order that depends on the application domain.
