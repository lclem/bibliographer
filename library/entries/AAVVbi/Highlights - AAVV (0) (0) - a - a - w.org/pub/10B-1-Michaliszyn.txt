Modal logic is called "elementary" if it is considered over class of frames definable by a first-order formula. Different formulae lead to different logics, and many of them find their applications in computer science. 
The aim of the Highlights conference talk is to present a wide picture of the latest research on the satisfiability problem of elementary modal logics. 
The talk will provide all the necessarily definitions, discuss the motivation, summarise the recent research papers on this topic, and discuss some open problems.
