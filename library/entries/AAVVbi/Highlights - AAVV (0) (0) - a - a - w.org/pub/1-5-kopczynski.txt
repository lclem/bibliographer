For a formula $\phi$ over a signature including predicates $P_1...P_k$,
we define the image of $\phi$ as the set of tuples $(n_1...n_k)$ such that
there is a model of $\phi$ where exactly $n_i$ elements satisfy $P_i$. For example,
if each author has written exactly 2 papers, and each paper has exactly 3 authors, then
2*total number of authors=3*total number of authors. This can be seen as a
generalization of the well known notion of a spectrum. Our main result is that,
for formulae of FO2C, spectra and images are definable in
Presburger arithmetic, and thus semilinear (and closed under complement).
