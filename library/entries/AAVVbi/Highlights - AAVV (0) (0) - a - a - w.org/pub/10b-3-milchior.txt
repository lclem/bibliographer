In this talk, we are interested by expressivity of automaton
reading a base b r-tuple of natural numbers. 

It is well known that those automaton recognize b-recognizable set.
We will study how to decide, in polynomial time if the set recognized
by an automaton is definable a smaller structure as \FO[+] or
\FO[<,\moda], and how to compute a formula in this structure that
accepts this set.
