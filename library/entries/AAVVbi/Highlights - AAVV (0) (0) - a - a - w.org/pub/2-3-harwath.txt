We study Gaifman and Hanf locality of an extension of first-order logic with modulo p counting quantifiers
(FO+MODp, for short) with arbitrary numerical predicates. We require that the validity of formulas is
independent of the particular interpretation of the numerical predicates and refer to such formulas as
arb-invariant formulas. We give a detailed picture of locality and non-locality properties of arb-
invariant FO+MODp.
