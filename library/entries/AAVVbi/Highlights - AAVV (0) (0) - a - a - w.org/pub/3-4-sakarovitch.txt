This work addresses, and proposes a solution to, the problem of the
validity of weighted automata in which epsilon-transitions may result in
infinite summations.

With a topological approach, a definition of validity is taken that insures
that any closure algorithm will succeed on every valid weighted automaton.
This definition is stable with respect to natural transformations of
automata.

Validity is shown to be decidable when weights are taken in Q or R. The
corresponding algorithm is implemented in the VAUCANSON platform.  The
problem remains open in general.
