We describe a general framework for static verification of systems
that base their decisions upon queries to databases. The database is
specified using constraints, typically a schema, and is not modified
during a run of the system. The system is equipped with  a finite
number of registers for storing intermediate information from the
database and the specification consists of a transition table described 
using quantifier-free formulas that can query either the database or the registers.

Our main result concerns systems querying XML databases -- modeled as
data trees -- using quantifier-free formulas with predicates such as
the descendant axis or comparison of data values.  

Our technique is based on the notion of amalgamation and is quite
general. For instance it also applies to relational databases (with
an optimal \pspace algorithm).
