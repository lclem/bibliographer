Metric temporal logic (MTL) is one of the most prominent specification
formalisms for real-time systems. Over infinite timed words, full MTL
is undecidable, but satisfiability for its safety fragment was proved
decidable several years ago. The problem is also known to be
equivalent to a fair termination problem for a class of channel
machines with insertion errors. However, the complexity has remained
elusive, except for a non-elementary lower bound. Via another
equivalent problem, namely termination for a class of rational
relations, we show that satisfiability for safety MTL is not primitive
recursive, yet is Ackermannian, i.e., among the simplest non-primitive
recursive problems. This is surprising since decidability was
originally established using Higman's Lemma, suggesting a much higher
non-multiply recursive complexity.
