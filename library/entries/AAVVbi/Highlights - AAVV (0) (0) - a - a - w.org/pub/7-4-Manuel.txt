We introduce and explore various fragments of $\mu$-calculus on data words. We show that full $\mu$-calculus is undecidable,
but its $\nu$-fragment is decidable by reduction to data automata. We disclose two subclasses of the $\nu$-fragment
that enjoy the further property of being closed under negation, namely the class of  Bounded Reversal (BR)
and the class of Bounded Mode Alternation (BMA). The latter is contained in the former class and 
is already sufficiently expressive for capturing several logics studied in the literature like $\fotwo$ 
and Data-LTL. We then characterize these two fragments as cascades of suitably defined transducer models. 
We finally prove the separation of BMA from BR using a novel paradigm of circuits and prove hierarchy theorems 
for BMA, Data-LTL and $\fotwo$.
