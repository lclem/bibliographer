FO Model Checking of Interval Graphs

We study the computational complexity of the model checking problem for the
first order (FO) logic on interval graphs, i.e., interscetion graphs of
intervals on the real line. As the main result we show that for n-vertex
interval graphs this problem can be solved in time O(n log n) if we take
intervals with lengths from a fixed finite set. On the other hand, we show
that this is no longer true once the interval lengths taken from any set
that is dense in some open subset.
