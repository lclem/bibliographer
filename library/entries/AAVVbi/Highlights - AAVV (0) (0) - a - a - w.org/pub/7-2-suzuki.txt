In several branches of computer sciences, automata are often used to
describe computational behaviours. Among those developments, automata
equipped with resource devices, e.g. a finite-memory or local
registers, and languages over infinite alphabets are collecting more
and more attentions. In this talk, we would like to discuss a possible
general theory for those resource-handling automata from the point of
nominal regular expressions. As already published works, we shall
present the laywered-technique and the Kleene-style theorem. On top,
as our ongoing work, by comparing possible actions (labels) on
transitions, we will provide how those actions differentiate their
language-recognisability and show the automata-hierarchy of languages
over infinite alphabets.
