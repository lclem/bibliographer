We introduce a novel automata-theoretic approach for the
verification of multi-agent systems. We present epistemic
alternating tree automata, an extension of alternating tree
automata, and use them to represent specifications in the
temporal epistemic logic CTLK. We show that model check-
ing a memory-less interpreted system against a CTLK prop-
erty can be reduced to checking the language non-emptiness
of the composition of two epistemic tree automata. We report
on an experimental implementation and discuss preliminary
results. We evaluate the effectiveness of the technique using
two real-life scenarios: a gossip protocol and the train gate
controller.
