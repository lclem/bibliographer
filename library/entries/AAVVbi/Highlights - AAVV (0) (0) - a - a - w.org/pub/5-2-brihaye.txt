Two-player zero-sum games on finite automata are a classical metaphor
for controller synthesis. An extension of this model to time-critical
systems are two-player games on priced timed automata. For those
games, the optimal reachability synthesis problem asks to compute a
strategy (for one of the players) that guarantees to reach a given
target with a total cost satisfying some optimality constraint. While,
some versions of this problem have already been showed undecidable, we
propose to complete the global picture by studying other variants
(such as the timed-bounded version).
