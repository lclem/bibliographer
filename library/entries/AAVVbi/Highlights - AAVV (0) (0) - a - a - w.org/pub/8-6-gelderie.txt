When studying games played on finite arenas, the arena is given
explicitly, hiding the underlying structure of the arena. We study games
where the global arena is a product of several smaller, constituent
arenas. We investigate how these ``global games'' can be solved by
playing ``component games'' on the constituent arenas. To this end, we
introduce two kinds of products of arenas. Moreover, we define a
suitable notion of strategy composition and show how, for the first
notion of product, winning strategies in reachability games can be
composed from winning strategies in games on the constituent arenas. For
the second kind of product, the complexity of solving the global game
shows that a general composition theorem is equivalent to proving Pspace
= Exptime.
