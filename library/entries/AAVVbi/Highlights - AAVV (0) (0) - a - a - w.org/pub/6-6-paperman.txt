In this talk, we introduce two properties for logical sentences using arbitrary numerical predicates: the Straubing property and the Crane Beach property. 
Both properties state that formulae defining simple languages do not need to use arbitrary complicated predicates, where simple either means regular or with a neutral letter.
We restrict our attention to monadic predicates, and show that both properties hold in a strong syntactical sense.
