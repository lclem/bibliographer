Guarded normal form requires occurrences of fixpoint variables in a μ-calculus-
formula to occur under the scope of a modal operator. The literature contains guarded
transformations that effectively bring a μ-calculus-formula into guarded normal form. We
show that the known guarded transformations can cause an exponential blowup in formula
size, contrary to existing claims of polynomial behaviour. We also show that any poly-
nomial guarded transformation for μ-calculus-formulas in the more relaxed vectorial form
gives rise to a polynomial solution algorithm for parity games, the existence of which is an
open problem.
