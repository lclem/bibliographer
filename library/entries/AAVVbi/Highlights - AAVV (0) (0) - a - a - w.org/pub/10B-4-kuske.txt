From Rabin's tree theorem, one can infer that the monadic second order
theory of the lexicographic order on any regular language is
decidable. The same holds for deterministic context-free languages
since they belong to Caucal's hierarchy. When dropping determinism,
not even the first-order theory remains decidable (\'Esik \&
Carayol). This talk demonstrates that undecidability occurs already for
\begin{itemize}
\item small fragments of first-order logic and
\item 1-counter automata that are very close to being deterministic.
\end{itemize}
