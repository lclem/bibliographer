Stochastic games provide a powerful framework to model fundamental
problems in the design and analysis of stochastic reactive
systems. While this connection is well understood, and several results
have enriched the framework, there is a wealth of research questions
that are open, including some long-standing ones (such as the
complexity of perfect-information stochastic reachability games). In
this talk, I will survey some recent results for general model of
stochastic games and related models. The talk is based on several
papers, and presents an overview of recent results based on joint
works with several co-authors, as well as results from other
researchers.
