					<h2>The Problem</h2>
					<p> There is a distinct community in theoretical computer science, which studies logic, games and automata. Results produced by this community are dispersed across many conferences, which makes them difficult to follow, and the community rarely gathers. Also, since conferences are mainly used for publication, there are few incentives to make good talks, and some incentives to make bad ones (e.g. splitting one result into many conference papers). </p>
				</div><div class="cline-white"></div><div class="cline-white-horiz"></div><div class="second-text">
					<h2>The Solution</h2>
					<p>A new conference: Highlights of Logic, Games and Automata. A visit to this conference gives you a wide picture of the latest research in the area. Also, a chance to meet everybody in the field, not just those who happen to publish in one particular proceedings volume.  We intend to achieve this popularity by having no proceedings, a short and cheap event, and building on the tradition of the similar proceedings-free <a href="http://www.games.rwth-aachen.de">GAMES workshop</a>. </p>

In the case of Petri nets, reachability was shown decidable in 1982, and the reachability problem for Petri nets and related decidable problems on subclasses of counter systems are pivot problems not only for the verification of infinite-state systems but also for problems appearing in very active research areas related to various logics and automata for data words/trees. Hence, the design of efficient algorithms for the reachability problem for VASS may have a great impact, not only in the realm of formal verification. It is however a very difficult problem. Therefore, improving the computational cost for solving the reachability problem for Petri nets would also improve the complexity of the formal verification of numerous classes of infinite-state systems.</p>
				<p>Strikingly, the decision algorithm for Petri net reachability has never been implemented. This is because of its high complexity, both conceptual (the algorithm is very hard to understand and to describe) and computational (it is assumed that the complexity of the algorithm is not primitive-recursive). The general problem is known to be decidable by algorithms exclusively based on the classical Kosaraju-Lambert-Mayr-Sacerdote-Tenney decomposition (KLMTS decomposition). Recently, from this decomposition, it was proved that a final configuration is not reachable from an initial one if, and only if, there exists a Presburger inductive invariant that contains the initial configuration but not the final one. Since we can decide if a Presburger formula denotes an inductive invariant, we deduce from this result that there exist checkable certificates of non-reachability in the Presburger arithmetic. In particular, there exists a simple algorithm for deciding the general Petri net reachability problem based on two semi-algorithms. A first one that tries to prove reachability by enumerating finite sequences of actions and a second one that tries to prove non-reachability by enumerating Presburger formulas.</p> <p>In this presentation, we provide a simple proof of the Petri net reachability problem that is not based on the KLMST decomposition. The proof is based on the notion of production relations, inspired from Hauschildt, that directly proves the existence of Presburger inductive invariants.</p></div></div><div class='full-text break'><span class='time'><span class='start'>13:00</span><span class='end'>14:30</span></span><span class='type'>Lunch</span></div><div class='full-text session'></span><span class='time'><span class='start'>14:30</span><span class='end'>18:00</span></span><span class='type'>Tutorial</span></div><div class='full-text paper'><span class='expander'></span><span class='time'><span class='start'>14:30</span><span class='end'>18:00</span></span><span class='authors'>Martin Grohe</span> <span class='title'>Tutorial: Logic for algorithms</span></div><div class='full-text abstract'><span class='slides-and-speaker'><a href='http://highlights-conference.org/pub/' target='_blank'>SLIDES</a> speaker: Martin Grohe</span><br/><div class='columned'><h4>Abstract</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The theme of this tutorial is (recent) applications of logic in the design and analysis of efficient algorithms. I will cover the following three topics.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<em>Logical techniques in the analysis of generic algorithms</em>
						<p>Certain generic (families of) algorithms, such as the  Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm for graph isomorphism testing and  k-consistency tests for constraint satisfaction problems have  logical characterisations. Thus logical techniques can be used to  analyse the power of these algorithms and also to prove lower  bounds for their running time.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Algorithmic meta theorems</em>
						<p>Algorithmic meta theorems attempt to explain and unify  algorithmic results by proving tractability not only for  individual problems, but for whole classes of problems. These  classes are typically defined in terms of logic. The prototypical  example of an algorithmic meta theorem is Courcelle's Theorem,  stating that all properties of graphs of bounded tree-width that  are definable in monadic second-order logic are decidable in  linear time.</p>
						<p>In the tutorial, I will focus on meta theorems for first-order  logic, where by now we have a fairly complete picture of graph  classes admitting a nontrivial meta theorem</p>
					</li>
					<li> <em>Applications of meta theorems in algorithmic graph structure theory</em>
						<p>In this last part I will discuss applications of algorithmic meta theorems to problems in algorithmic graph structure theory. By this I mean graph algorithms that use meta theorems to solve tasks for which no other (direct combinatorial) algorithm is known.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>It is worth noting that the algorithmic problems considered in all three parts are not derived from logic, such as satisfiability or model-checking problems, but "standard" algorithmic problems, often with a strong combinatorial and graph theoretical flavour. On the way, I will introduce the necessary graph theory, including nowhere dense graphs and certain aspects of graph minor theory.</p></div></div><h3 class='full-text'>Thursday 19 September</h3><div class='full-text session'></span><span class='time'><span class='start'>09:00</span><span class='end'>09:50</span></span><span class='type'>Invited talk</span></div><div class='full-text paper'><span class='expander'></span><span class='time'><span class='start'>09:00</span><span class='end'>09:50</span></span><span class='authors'>Patrice Godefroid</span> <span class='title'>Invited talk: 500 Machine-years of software model checking and SMT solving</span></div><div class='full-text abstract'><span class='slides-and-speaker'><a href='http://highlights-conference.org/pub/godefroid.pdf' target='_blank'>SLIDES</a> speaker: Patrice Godefroid</span><br/><div class='columned'><h4>Abstract</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will report on our experience running SAGE for over 500-machine
years in Microsoft's security testing labs. SAGE is a whitebox fuzzing
tool for security testing. It performs symbolic execution dynamically
at the binary (x86) level, generates constraints on program inputs,
and solves those constraints with an SMT solver in order to generate
new inputs to exercize previously uncovered program paths or trigger
security vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows). This process is
repeated using novel state-space exploration techniques that attempt
to sweep through all (in practice, many) feasible execution paths of
the program while checking simultaneously many properties. This
approach thus combines program analysis, testing, model checking and
automated theorem proving (constraint solving).

Since 2009, SAGE has been running 24/7 on average 100+ machines
automatically ``fuzzing'' hundreds of applications. This is the
largest computational usage ever for any SMT solver, with over 4
billion constraints processed to date. In the process, SAGE found many
new security vulnerabilities (missed by blackbox fuzzing and static
program analysis) and was credited to have found roughly one third of
all the bugs discovered by file fuzzing during the development of
Microsoft's Windows 7, saving millions of dollars by avoiding
expensive security patches to nearly a billion PCs.

In this talk, I will present the SAGE project, highlight connections
with program verification, and discuss open research challenges.

This is joint work with Michael Levin, David Molnar, Ella Bounimova,
and other contributors.

Since an incomplete database can represent multiple databases, query answering boils down to solving an entailment problem, while database systems are good at performing model-checking algorithms on first-order structures. Thus, to take advantage of them, we need to understand when entailment can be reduced to model-checking. We show that this happens for queries which are monotone with respect to the semantics of incompleteness, and that such monotonicity can be described via homomorphism preservation, for different notions of homomorphisms. Combining the latter with preservation theorems from logic (existing as well as new), we obtain classes of queries for which standard database systems can correctly compute answers over incomplete databases, or, logically speaking, for which entailment can be solved by simple model-checking.

topology affects the languages used to extract information from graph databases.

It is known that evaluation of semantically acyclic unions of CQs - i.e., unions of CQs that are equivalent to a union of acyclic ones - is tractable.

We study the notion of semantic acyclicity in the context of graph databases and unions of conjunctive regular path queries (UCRPQs). We prove that checking whether a UCRPQ is semantically acyclic is decidable in 2ExpSpace and is ExpSpace-hard. We show that evaluation of semantically acyclic UCRPQs is fixed-parameter tractable.

Recently, an extension called the guarded negation fragment (GNFO) was shown to have interpolation, but the proof was non-constructive. The goal in this research (suggested by Benedikt, ten Cate, and Lutz) is to develop constructive methods for interpolation, in order to see whether interpolation can be performed in practice and to better understand the complexity of the problem. I describe some preliminary work on constructive interpolation for GNFO.

we define the image of $\phi$ as the set of tuples $(n_1...n_k)$ such that
there is a model of $\phi$ where exactly $n_i$ elements satisfy $P_i$. For example,
if each author has written exactly 2 papers, and each paper has exactly 3 authors, then
2*total number of authors=3*total number of authors. This can be seen as a
generalization of the well known notion of a spectrum. Our main result is that,

the learning algorithm and the expressiveness of the hypothesis that one is
allowed to learn. Even though this trade-off is present in almost every machine
learning task, it is hard to capture formally and still often resolved based
on instinct and experience. We propose using parametrized logical formulas
to represent hypotheses and then exploit propositional solvers for efficient
learning and results from descriptive complexity to get expressiveness
guarantees. This allows a more systematic study of the above trade-off and,
as we show on a few examples, it is applicable to practical learning tasks.

In particular, as shown by Thomas Colcombet, proving the existence of finite-memory winning strategies for (some) boundedness games is the last missing item to prove the decidability of cost-MSO over infinite trees.

Our notion of regularity relies on the notion of string-to-tree transducers, and allows associating costs with events that are conditioned on regular properties of future events. CRAs compute regular functions using multiple write-only registers whose values can be combined using the allowed set of operations. We then discuss various analysis problems associated with CRAs and regular functions, including the decidability of equivalance and containment, register and state minimization, and Angluin-style learning of cost functions.

For this reason we propose alernative definitions of stability, which we call local and hybrid variance, and which express how rewards on each run deviate from the run's own mean-payoff and from the expected mean-payoff, respectively. We show that a strategy ensuring both the expected mean-payoff and the variance below given bounds requires randomization and memory, under all the above semantics of variance.

finite model theory and database theory. It asks whether there is a  logic in which a property of finite structures is definable if, and only if,
it is decidable in polynomial time.

Much of the research in this area has focused on the logic FPC, the extension
of least or inflationary fixed-point logic by counting terms. In fact, FPC has been shown to capture PTIME on many natural classes of structures. On the other side, already in 1992, a graph query has been
constructed that can be decided in PTIME but is not definable in FPC. But while this CFI query, as it is now called, is very elegant and has led to new insights in many different areas, it can hardly be called a natural problem in polynomial time. Therefore it was often remarked that possibly all natural polynomial-time properties of finite structures could be expressed in
FPC. However, this hope was eventually refuted in a strong sense by Atserias,
Bulatov and Dawar who proved that the important problem of  solvability of
linear equation systems (over any finite Abelian group) is not definable in FPC and that, indeed, the CFI query reduces to this problem.

This motivates the study of the relationship between finite model theory and linear algebra, and suggests that operators from linear
algebra, such as matrix ranks or solvability operators, could be a source of new extensions to fixed-point logic, in an  attempt to find a logical characterisation of PTIME.

We will discuss such approaches and study the relations between different polynomial-time computable problems over (finite) rings, fields and Abelian groups in the context of logical many-to-one and Turing reductions,
i.e., interpretations and generalised quantiers.
In this context, we will also discuss an alternative approach towards
a logic for PTIME, proposed by Blass, Gurevich and Shelah, based on choiceless computations operating directly on structures.</div></div><div class='full-text break'><span class='time'><span class='start'>09:50</span><span class='end'>10:00</span></span><span class='type'>Break</span></div><div class='full-text session'></span><span class='time'><span class='start'>10:00</span><span class='end'>11:12</span></span><span class='type'>Session 6</span></div><div class='full-text paper'><span class='expander'></span><span class='time'><span class='start'>10:00</span><span class='end'>10:12</span></span><span class='authors'>Matthew Anderson and Anuj Dawar</span> <span class='title'>On symmetric circuits and FPC</span></div><div class='full-text abstract'><span class='slides-and-speaker'><a href='http://highlights-conference.org/pub/6-1-dawar.pdf' target='_blank'>SLIDES</a> speaker: Anuj Dawar</span><br/><div class='columned'><h4>Abstract</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;We study queries on graphs (and other relational structures) defined

that base their decisions upon queries to databases. The database is
specified using constraints, typically a schema, and is not modified
during a run of the system. The system is equipped with  a finite
number of registers for storing intermediate information from the
database and the specification consists of a transition table described 
using quantifier-free formulas that can query either the database or the registers.

Our main result concerns systems querying XML databases -- modeled as
data trees -- using quantifier-free formulas with predicates such as
the descendant axis or comparison of data values.  

Our technique is based on the notion of amalgamation and is quite
general. For instance it also applies to relational databases (with
an optimal \pspace algorithm).

is not the case for countable games, the best-known example being Wald's

existence of equilibria in infinite games. These conditions are
typically of topological nature and are not applicable to countable
games. Here we establish
an existence result for the equilibrium of countable games when the strategy
sets are a countable group and the payoffs are functions of the group operation.
In order to obtain the existence of equilibria, finitely additive mixed
strategies
have to be allowed. This creates a problem of selection of a product measure of
mixed strategies. We propose a family of such selections and prove existence of
an equilibrium that does not depend on the selection. As a byproduct we show
that if finitely additive mixed strategies are allowed, then Wald's game admits
an equilibrium.</div></div><div class='full-text break'><span class='time'><span class='start'>15:20</span><span class='end'>15:30</span></span><span class='type'>Break</span></div><div class='full-text session'></span><span class='time'><span class='start'>15:36</span><span class='end'>16:48</span></span><span class='type'>Session 8</span></div><div class='full-text paper'><span class='expander'></span><span class='time'><span class='start'>15:36</span><span class='end'>15:48</span></span><span class='authors'>Stéphane Le Roux</span> <span class='title'>Infinite sequential Nash equilibrium</span></div><div class='full-text abstract'><span class='slides-and-speaker'><a href='http://highlights-conference.org/pub/8-1-le_roux.pdf	' target='_blank'>SLIDES</a> speaker: Le Roux Stephane</span><br/><div class='columned'><h4>Abstract</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;Borel determinacy says that all infinite-tree win-lose two-player games have a Nash equilibrium provided that the winning sets of the players are Borel.

in which some positions can be singled out as being *basic*, in the sense
that (1) matches proceed in *rounds*, moving from one basic position to 
another, and (2) when determining the winner of an infinite match, only 
the basic positions matter.

We introduce a notion of bisimulation between two such games that 
combines Pauly's bisimulation between extensive strategic games, with a 
combinatorial part for the parity condition.

Applications include the proof of complementation lemmas in automata
theory.

Vardi</span><br/><div class='columned'><h4>Abstract</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the surprising developments in the area of program verification in the late part of the 20th Century is the emergence of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), a logic that emerged in philisophical studies of free will, as the cannonical language for describing temporal behavior of computer systems. LTL, however, is not expressive enough for industrial applications.
The first decade of the 21 Century saw the emergence of industrial temporal logics such as ForSpec, PSL, and SVA. These logics, however, are not clean enough to serve as objects of theoretical study. This talk will describe the
rise and fall of LTL, and will propose a new cannonical temporal logic: Linear Dynamic Logic (LDL).</div></div><div class='full-text break'><span class='time'><span class='start'>09:50</span><span class='end'>10:00</span></span><span class='type'>Break</span></div><div class='full-text session'></span><span class='time'><span class='start'>10:00</span><span class='end'>11:15</span></span><span class='type'>Session 10A</span></div><div class='full-text paper'><span class='expander'></span><span class='time'><span class='start'>10:00</span><span class='end'>10:15</span></span><span class='authors'>Fabio Mogavero, Aniello Murano and Luigi Sauro</span> <span class='title'>On the boundary of behavioral strategies</span></div><div class='full-text abstract'><span class='slides-and-speaker'><a href='http://highlights-conference.org/pub/10A-1-murano.pdf' target='_blank'>SLIDES</a> speaker: Aniello Murano</span><br/><div class='columned'><h4>Abstract</h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;In multi-agent games, a recent contribution is given by Strategy Logic (SL), 
a powerful formalism that allows to reason explicitly about strategies as first order objects. 
The price to pay for the high expressiveness of SL is that it admits non-behavioral strategies, 
i.e., a choice of an agent in a play may depend on choices made in another counterfactual play. 
As the latter moves are unpredictable, these strategies cannot be synthesized in practice.

In this talk, we introduce two maximal syntactical fragments of SL admitting behavioral strategies only. 
As a consequence, we show that the model-checking problem for both fragments is solvable in 2EXPTIME, 
as it is for the subsumed ATL*.

Iterated admissibility is a well-known and important concept in classical game theory, e.g. to determine rational behaviors in multi-player matrix games.
As recently shown by Berwanger, this concept can be soundly extended to infinite games played on graphs with omega-regular objectives.
In this talk, we study the algorithmic properties of this concept for such games.
We settle the exact complexity of natural decision problems on the set of strategies that survive iterated elimination of dominated strategies.
As a byproduct of our construction, we obtain automata which recognize all the possible outcomes of such strategies.

We propose a compositional proof rule which splits a given CL formula into two parts, a decidable CL formula and another, simplified, CL formula. Applying the rule repeatedly transforms the original CL formula into a collection of decidable CL formulas.
Our proof system is a complete framework for the synthesis of distributed systems.

The class of languages recognisable by unambiguous tree automata is still not well-understood. In this paper we show the following complexity collapse: if A is an unambiguous Buchi tree automaton then L(A) is recognisable by a weak alternating automaton. We present also some extensions of this result. To our best knowledge this is the first parity index collapse that exploits unambiguity of an automaton.

 We prove that iterating the operation yields topologically harder and harder sets. 
 As an illustration, we might note that application of the operation to the empty language already produces a non-Borel set, and the next application of the operation produces a set that is outside the sigma-field generated by analytic sets.
 Moreover, we show how to perform a limit step of the iteration.

It can express the same statements, but in a more concise and readable way.

In this work, we focus on control of Markov decision processes with non-negative real-valued costs. We develop an algorithm to design a control strategy that guarantees the satisfaction of a correctness specification expressed as a formula of Linear Temporal Logic, while at the same time minimizing the expected average cost between two consecutive satisfactions of a desired property. The existing solutions to this problem in control theory are sub-optimal. By leveraging ideas from automata-based model checking and game theory, we provide an optimal solution.

Interactive Markov chains (IMC) are compositional behavioural models similar to continuous-time Markov decision processes. Given a time-bounded property, an IMC component and a specification of the environment, we synthesize a scheduler optimizing the probability that the property is satisfied when the IMC is working in an unknown environment that satisfies the specification. In this talk we focus on a two-player continuous-time stochastic game model that we call controller-environment games that is the crucial step in the solution of the problem above.

Their proof uses parity automata with a transition map defined in

three parts:
(1) automata-theoretic characterizations of MSO and MC respectively,
(2) a simple model-theoretic characterization of the identity-free
fragment of monadic first-order logic, and
(3) a coalgebraic result, stating that the second result propagates 
from the `one-step level' to the level of full fixpoint logics.

For any k >= 1 and semiring S, the set of sequences with output in S is the carrier of a final coalgebra. This allows us to give a coalgebraic characterization of the k-regular sequences. Using an isomorphism based on a bijective numeration system, we thus obtain a structural correspondence between S-rational series over k nonterminals, and k-regular sequences with output in S.

The complexity theoretic reductions behind these results establish explicit and effective connections between combinatory logic inhabitation and automata theoretic models, in the form of alternating tree automata and alternating space bounded Turing machines. These computational models that are commonly found in automata theoretic approaches are related to synthesis based on logics within the MSO family of logics.

The idea of using modalities as programming constructs has been largely unexplored. We add epistemic and spatial modalities as part of the programming language, not just as part of the meta-language to reason about protocols. 

We introduce spatial and epistemic process calculi to reason about information and knowledge distributed among agents in a system. We give domain-theoretic structures to represent this information, operational and denotational means to reason about possibly infinite behavior, and  compact versions of infinite objects to simulate public announcement.</div></div>
