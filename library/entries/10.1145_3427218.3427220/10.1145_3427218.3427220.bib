  Abstract      = "We present in this extended abstract a new software designed to work with generating functions that count walks in the quarter plane. With this software we offer a cohesive package that brings together all the required procedures for manipulating these generating functions, as well as a unified interface to deal with them. We also display results that this package offers on a public webpage.",
