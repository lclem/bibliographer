	Abstract = {Abstract We survey some of the main points of contact between model theory and differential algebra. We will discuss the development of differentially closed fields, which stands at the center of the relationship between the two branches of mathematics. We will also explore recent developments in model theory of real valued function, difference algebra, and other related structures.},
