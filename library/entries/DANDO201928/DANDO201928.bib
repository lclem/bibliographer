  Abstract      = "This paper deals with the conversion of expressions denoting Hadamard series into weighted rotating automata. We prove that any algorithm converting rational series into one-way weighted automata can be extended to provide an algorithm which achieves our goal. We apply this to define the derivation and the follow automata of a Hadamard expression. Our method may also be used to extend algorithms which perform the inverse conversion, but it is required to enhance the algorithm to fulfil some constraints.",
