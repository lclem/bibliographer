  Abstract      = "We consider numerical functions weakly computable by grammar-controlled vector addition systems (GVASes, a variant of pushdown Petri nets). GVASes can weakly compute all fast growing functions F α F\_\alpha for α < ω ω \alpha<\omega^\omega , hence they are computationally more powerful than standard vector addition systems. On the other hand they cannot weakly compute the inverses F − 1 α F\_\alpha^{-1} or indeed any sublinear function. The proof relies on a pumping lemma for runs of GVASes that is of independent interest.",
