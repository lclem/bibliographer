  Abstract      = {In this article, we give two new algorithms to find the polynomial and rational function solutions of a given holonomic system associated to a set of linear differential operators in the Weyl algebra D=k〈x1,{\ldots},xn,∂1,{\ldots},∂n〉, where k is a computable subfield of the complex numbers. Both algorithms are based on the theory of D-modules -- the first algorithm obtains degree bounds on the solutions through Gr{\"o}bner deformations and b-functions while the second algorithm evaluates the dimension of the solutions through duality and restriction.},
