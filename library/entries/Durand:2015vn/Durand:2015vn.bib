  Abstract      = "We study the extension of dependence logic {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}mathcal {\{}D{\}}{\$}{\$}by a majority quantifier {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}mathsf{\{}M{\}}{\$}{\$}over finite structures. We show that the resulting logic is equi-expressive with the extension of second-order logic by second-order majority quantifiers of all arities. Our results imply that, from the point of view of descriptive complexity theory, {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}mathcal {\{}D{\}}({$\backslash$}mathsf{\{}M{\}}){\$}{\$}captures the complexity class counting hierarchy. We also obtain characterizations of the individual levels of the counting hierarchy by fragments of {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}mathcal {\{}D{\}}({$\backslash$}mathsf{\{}M{\}}){\$}{\$}.",
