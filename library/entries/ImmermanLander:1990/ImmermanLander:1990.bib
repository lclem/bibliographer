	Abstract = {In this paper we ask the question, ``What must be added to first-order logic plus least-fixed point to obtain exactly the polynomial-time properties of unordered graphs?'' We consider the languages Lkconsisting of first-order logic restricted to k variables and Ckconsisting of Lkplus ``counting quantifiers''. We give efficient canonization algorithms for graphs characterized by Ckor Lk. It follows from known results that all trees and almost all graphs are characterized by C2.},
