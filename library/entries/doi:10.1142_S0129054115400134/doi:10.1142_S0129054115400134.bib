	Abstract = {The decidability of equivalence for three important classes of tree transducers is discussed. Each class can be obtained as a natural restriction of deterministic macro tree transducers (MTTs): (1) no context parameters, i.e., top-down tree transducers, (2) linear size increase, i.e., MSO definable tree transducers, and (3) monadic input and output ranked alphabets. For the full class of mtts, decidability of equivalence remains a long-standing open problem.},
