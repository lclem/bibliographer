	Abstract = {We show how recent results concerning quantitative forms of automata help providing refined understanding of the properties of a system (for instance, a program). In particular, combining the size-change abstraction together with results concerning the asymptotic behavior of tropical automata yields extremely fine complexity analysis of some pieces of code.},
