	Abstract = {In order to study precisely the growth of timed languages, we associate to such a language a generating function. These functions (tightly related to volume and entropy of timed languages) satisfy compositionality properties and, for deterministic timed regular languages, can be characterized by integral equations. We provide procedures for closed-form computation of generating functions for some classes of timed automata and regular expressions.},
