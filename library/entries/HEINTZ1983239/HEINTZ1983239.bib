  Abstract      = "The Bezout-Inequality, an affine version (not including multiplicities) of the classical Bezout-Theorem is derived for applications in algebraic complexity theory. Upper bounds for the cardinality and number of sets definable by first order formulas over algebraically closed fields are given. This is used for fast quantifier elimination in algebraically closed fields.",
