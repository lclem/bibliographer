  Abstract      = "Pumping lemmas are created to prove that given languages are not belong to certain language classes. There are several known pumping lemmas for the whole class and some special classes of the context-free languages. In this paper we prove new, interesting pumping lemmas for special linear and context-free language classes. Some of them can be used to pump regular languages in two place simultaneously. Other lemma can be used to pump context-free languages in arbitrary many places.",
