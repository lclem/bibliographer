	Abstract = {In this paper, we study several sublogics of monadic second-order logic over countable linear orderings, such as first-order logic, first-order logic on cuts, weak monadic second-order logic, weak monadic second-order logic with cuts, as well as fragments of monadic second-order logic in which sets have to be well ordered or scattered. We give decidable algebraic characterizations of all these logics and compare their respective expressive power.},
