  Abstract      = "{Sequences of numbers (either natural integers, or integers or rational) of level $k \in \bbbn$ have been defined in \cite{Fra-Sen06} as the sequences which can be computed by deterministic pushdown automata of level $k$. We extend this definition to sequences of {\em words} indexed by {\em words}. We give characterisations of these sequences in terms of ``higher-order'' L-systems. In particular sequences of rational numbers of level 3 are characterised by polynomial recurrences (which generalize the P-recurrent sequences studied in \cite{Sta80}). The equality problem for sequences of rational numbers of level 3 is shown decidable.}",
