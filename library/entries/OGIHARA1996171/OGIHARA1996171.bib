  Abstract      = "For any operatorτon integer-valued functions, we say that \#P isclosed under τ in the context ofPF∘\#P if, for everyf∈\#P,τ[f] belongs to PF∘num;P. For several operatorsτ, it is shown that the closure properties of \#P underτin the above sense is closely related to the relationships between P\#P[1]and higher classes such as PHPPand PPPP.",
