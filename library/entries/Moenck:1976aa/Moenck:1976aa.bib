	Abstract = {The current proposals for applying the so called ``fast''O(N logaN) algorithms to multivariate polynomials is that the univariate methods be applied recursively, much in the way more conventional algorithms are used. Since the size of the problems is rather large for which a ``fastrd algorithm is more efficient than a classical one, the recursive approach compounds this size completely out of any practical range''.},
