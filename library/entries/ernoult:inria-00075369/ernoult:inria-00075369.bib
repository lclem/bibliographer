  Abstract      = {{Strictness analysis has been investigated in order to cover in one hand higher-order strictness analysis, on the other hand strictness analysis on non-flat domains. This paper presents a general method extending higher-order strictness analysis in order to subsume non-flat domains. The method uses the notion of strictness pairs and the notion of projection from domain theory. It allows to deal with the "n-th" strictness of a component of any kind of data structures}},
