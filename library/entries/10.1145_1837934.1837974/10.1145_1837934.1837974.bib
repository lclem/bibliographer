	Abstract = {We consider two algorithms which can be used for proving positivity of sequences that are defined by a linear recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients (P-finite sequences). Both algorithms have in common that while they do succeed on a great many examples, there is no guarantee for them to terminate, and they do in fact not terminate for every input. For some restricted classes of P-finite recurrence equations of order up to three we provide a priori criteria that assert the termination of the algorithms.},
