	Abstract = {In this paper, we present an algorithm for computing Gr{\"o}bner bases of linear ideals in a difference polynomial ring over a ground difference field. The input difference polynomials generating the ideal are also assumed to be linear. The algorithm is an adaptation to difference ideals of our polynomial algorithm based on Janet-like reductions.},
