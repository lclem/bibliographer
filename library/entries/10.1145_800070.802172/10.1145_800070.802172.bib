	Abstract = {Let k be a constant â‰¥ 2, and let us consider only deterministic k-tape Turing machines.We assume t2(n) \&gt; n and t2 is computable in time t2. Then there is a language which is accepted in time t2, but not accepted in any time t1 with t1(n) = o(t2(n)).Furthermore, we obtain a strong hierarchy (isomorphic to the rationals Q) for languages accepted in fixed space and variable time.},
