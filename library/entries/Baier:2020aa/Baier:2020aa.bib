  Abstract      = "In this paper we look at one of the seminal works of Rob van Glabbeek from a probabilistic angle. We develop the bisimulation spectrum with silent moves for probabilistic models, namely Markov decision processes. Especially the treatment of divergence makes this endeavour challenging. We provide operational as well as logical characterisations of a total of 32 bisimilarities.",
