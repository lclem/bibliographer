	Abstract = {We introduce factorization forests. It is shown that the vertex set of a dense factorization forest of finite height satisfies a bounded gap Ramsey-type property of words. The main result is that every morphism from a free semigroup to a finite semigroup S admits a Ramseyan factorization forest of height at most 9|S|. Techniques for constructed factorization forests are developed.},
