  Abstract      = "We extend normalization by evaluation (first presented in [5]) from the pure typed Î»-calculus to general higher type term rewriting systems and prove its correctness w.r.t. a domain-theoretic model. We distinguish between computational rules and proper rewrite rules. The former is a rather restricted class of rules, which, however, allows for a more efficient implementation.",
