  Abstract      = "We study planar walks that start from a given point (i0j0), take their steps in a finite set {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathfrak{\{}S{\}}{\$}{\$}, and are confined in the first quadrant x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0. Their enumeration can be attacked in a systematic way: the generating function Q(x, y; t) that counts them by their length (variable t) and the coordinates of their endpoint (variables x, y) satisfies a linear functional equation encoding the step-by-step description of walks. For instance, for the square lattice walks starting from the origin this equation reads {\$}{\$}{\backslash}left( {\{}xy - t(x + y + {\{}x^2{\}}y + x{\{}y^2{\}}){\}} {\backslash}right) {\{}{\backslash}text{\{}Q(x,y;t){\}}{\}} {\{}{\backslash}text{\{} = {\}}{\}} {\{}{\backslash}text{\{}xy - xtQ(x,0;t) - ytQ(0,y;t){\}}{\}}{\{}{\backslash}text{\{}.{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}",
