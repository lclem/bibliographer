  Abstract      = "The research in this paper is motivated by the open question: ``Is the complexity of a finite semigroup S decidable?'' Following the lead of the Presentation Lemma (Rhodes), we describe the finest cover on S that can be computed using an aperiodic semigroup and give an explicit relation. The central idea of the proof is that an aperiodic computation can be described by a new `blow-up operator' HÏ‰. The proof also relies on the Rhodes expansion of S and on Zeiger coding.",
