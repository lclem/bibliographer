	Abstract = {Let KF be the group algebra over the commutative field K of the free group F. It is proved that the field generated by KF in any Mal'cev-Neumann embedding for KF is the universal field of fractions U(KF) of KF. Some consequences are noted. An example is constructed of an embedding $KF \subset D$ into a field D with $D \not\simeq U(KF)$. It is also proved that the generalized free product of two free groups can be embedded in a field.},
