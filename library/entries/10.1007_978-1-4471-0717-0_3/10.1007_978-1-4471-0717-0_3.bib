	Abstract = {First of all, a disclaimer. I am not a historian. My interest in the development of Recursion Theory is not academic, but cultural. I want to know if and how the basic ideas and methods used in a restricted area of Logic derive from, or at least interact with, a wider mathematical and intellectual experience. I can only offer suggestions, not scholarly arguments, to those who share my interest.},
