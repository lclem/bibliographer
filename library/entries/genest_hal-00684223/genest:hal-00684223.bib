  Abstract      = "{We consider the distributed control problem in the setting of Zielonka asynchronous automata. Such automata are compositions of finite processes communicating via shared actions and evolving asynchronously. Most importantly, processes participating in a shared action can exchange complete information about their causal past. This gives more power to controllers, and avoids simple pathological undecidable cases as in the setting of Pnueli and Rosner. We show the decidability of the control problem for Zielonka automata over acyclic communication architectures. We provide also a matching lower bound, which is l-fold exponential, l being the height of the architecture tree.}",
