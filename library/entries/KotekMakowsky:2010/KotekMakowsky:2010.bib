  Abstract      = "We consider functions of natural numbers which allow a combinatorial interpretation as counting functions (speed) of classes of relational structures, such as Fibonacci numbers, Bell numbers, Catalan numbers and the like. Many of these functions satisfy a linear recurrence relation over {\$}{\backslash}mathbb Z{\$}or {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb Z{\}}{\\_}m{\$}and allow an interpretation as counting the number of relations satisfying a property expressible in Monadic Second Order Logic (MSOL).",
