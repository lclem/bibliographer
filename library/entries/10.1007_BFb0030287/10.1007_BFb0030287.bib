	Abstract = {An algorithm is described producing for each formula of the first order theory of algebraically closed fields an equivalent free of quantifiers one. Denote by N a number of polynomials occuring in the formula, by d an upper bound on the degrees of polynomials, by n a number of variables, by a a number of quantifier alternations (in the prefix form). Then the algorithm works within the polynomial in the formula's size and in (Nd)n(2a+2) time. Up to now a bound (Nd)no(n) was known ([5], [7], [15]).},
