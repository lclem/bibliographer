  Abstract      = "We define NLC{\$}{\\_}k\^{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\}}{\$}to be the restriction of the class of graphs NLCk, where relabelling functions are exclusively taken from a set {\$}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\$}of functions from {\{}1,...,k{\}} into {\{}1,...,k{\}}. We characterize the sets of functions {\$}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\$}for which NLC{\$}{\\_}k\^{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\}}{\$}is well-quasi-ordered by the induced subgraph relation ≤i. Precisely, these sets {\$}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\$}are those which satisfy that for every {\$}f,g{$\backslash$}in {$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\$}, we have Im(f ∘g) = Im(f) or Im(g ∘f) = Im(g). To obtain this, we show that words (or trees) on {\$}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\$}are well-quasi-ordered by a relation slightly more constrained than the usual subword (or subtree) relation. A class of graphs is n-well-quasi-ordered if the collection of its vertex-labellings into n colors forms a well-quasi-order under ≤i, where ≤irespects labels. Pouzet (C R Acad Sci, Paris S{\'e}r A--B 274:1677--1680, 1972) conjectured that a 2-well-quasi-ordered class closed under induced subgraph is in fact n-well-quasi-ordered for every n. A possible approach would be to characterize the 2-well-quasi-ordered classes of graphs. In this respect, we conjecture that such a class is always included in some well-quasi-ordered NLC{\$}{\\_}k\^{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\}}{\$}for some family {\$}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\$}. This would imply Pouzet's conjecture.",
