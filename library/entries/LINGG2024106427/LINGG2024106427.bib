	Abstract = {One of the most fundamental problems in computational learning theory is the problem of learning a finite automaton A consistent with a finite set P of positive examples and with a finite set N of negative examples. By consistency, we mean that A accepts all strings in P and rejects all strings in N. It is well known that this problem is NP-complete. In the literature, it is stated that NP-hardness holds even in the case of a binary alphabet. As a standard reference for this theorem, the work of Gold from 1978 is either cited or adapted. Nevertheless, the results in Gold's work are stated in terms of Mealy machines, and not in terms of deterministic finite automata (DFAs) as most commonly defined. As Mealy machines are equipped with an output function, they can be more compact than DFAs which accept the same language. We show that the adaptations of Gold's construction for Mealy machines stated in the literature have some issues, and provide a correct proof for the fact that the DFA-consistency problem for binary alphabets is NP-complete.},
