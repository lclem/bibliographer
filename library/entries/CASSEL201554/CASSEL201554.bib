	Abstract = {We present a novel canonical automaton model, based on register automata, that can be used to specify protocol or program behavior. Register automata have a finite control structure and a finite number of registers (variables), and process sequences of terms that carry data values from an infinite domain. We consider register automata that compare data values for equality. A major contribution is the definition of a canonical automaton representation of any language recognizable by a deterministic register automaton, by means of a Nerode congruence. This canonical form is well suited for modeling, e.g., protocols or program behavior. Our model can be exponentially more succinct than previous proposals, since it filters out `accidental' relations between data values. This opens the way to new practical applications, e.g., in automata learning.},
