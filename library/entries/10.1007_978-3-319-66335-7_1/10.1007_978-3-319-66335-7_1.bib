	Abstract = {We prove an analog of Parikh's theorem for weighted context-free grammars over commutative, idempotent semirings, and exhibit a stochastic context-free grammar with behavior that cannot be realized by any stochastic right-linear context-free grammar. Finally, we show that every unary stochastic context-free grammar with polynomially-bounded ambiguity has an equivalent stochastic right-linear context-free grammar.},
