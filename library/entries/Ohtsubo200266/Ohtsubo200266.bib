	Abstract = {We consider the minimizing risk problems in discounted Markov decisions processes with countable state space and bounded general rewards. We characterize optimal values for finite and infinite horizon cases and give two sufficient conditions for the existence of an optimal policy in an infinite horizon case. These conditions are closely connected with Lemma 3 in White (1993), which is not correct as Wu and Lin (1999) point out. We obtain a condition for the lemma to be true, under which we show that there is an optimal policy. Under another condition we show that an optimal value is a unique solution to some optimality equation and there is an optimal policy on a transient set.},
