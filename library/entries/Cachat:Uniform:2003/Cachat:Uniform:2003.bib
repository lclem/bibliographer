	Abstract = {Walukiewicz gave in 1996 a solution for parity games on pushdown graphs: he proved the existence of pushdown strategies and determined the winner with an \{EXPTIME\} procedure. We give a new presentation and a new algorithmic proof of these results, obtain a uniform solution for parity games (independent of their initial configuration), and extend the results to prefix-recognizable graphs. The winning regions of the players are proved to be effectively regular, and winning strategies are computed.},
