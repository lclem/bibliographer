	Abstract = {Register automata are an expressive model of computation using finite memory. Conformance checking of their properties can be reduced to {\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsc {\{}NonEmptiness{\}}{\$}{\$}NONEMPTINESStests, however, this problem is {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}PSPACE{\}}{\$}{\$}PSPACE-complete. Existing approaches usually employ symbolic state exploration. This results in state explosion for most complex register automata. We propose a semantics-preserving transformation of register automata into a representation in which reachability of states is equivalent to reachability of locations, i.e., is in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}NL{\}}{\$}{\$}NL. We evaluate the algorithm on random-generated and real-world automata and show that it avoids state explosion and performs better on most instances than a comparable existing approach. This yields a practical approach to conformance checking of register automata.},
