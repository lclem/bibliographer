  Abstract      = "In this paper we compare four notions of fair simulation: direct [9], delay [12], game [19], and exists [16]. Our comparison refers to three main aspects: The time complexity of constructing the fair simulation, the ability to use it for minimization, and the relationship between the fair simulations and universal branching-time logics. We developed a practical application that is based on this comparison. The application is a new implementation for the assume-guarantee modular framework presented By Grumberg at al. in [ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS), 16 (1994) 843]. The new implementation significantly improves the complexity of the framework.",
