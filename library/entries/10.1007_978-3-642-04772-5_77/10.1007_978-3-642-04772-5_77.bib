	Abstract = {The modern development of nonlinear control theory is related mainly to the use of algebraic methods which show great applicability to solve a number of nonlinear control problems. Recently, the power of such methods were extended by introducing the concept of transfer functions of nonlinear systems. Such a concept represents a generalization, for the transfer functions of nonlinear systems have many analogical properties like those of linear systems. In this chapter some basic properties of the transfer function formalism of nonlinear systems are briefly discussed and references to possible applications are given.},
