  Abstract      = "We show that, over \${\mathbb Q}\$, if an \$n\$-variate polynomial of degree \$d = n^{O(1)}\$ is computable by an arithmetic circuit of size \$s\$ (respectively, by an arithmetic branching program of size \$s\$), then it can also be computed by a depth-3 circuit (i.e., a \$\Sigma \Pi \Sigma\$ circuit) of size \$\exp(O(\sqrt{d \log n \log d\log s}))\$ (respectively, of size \$\exp(O(\sqrt{d \log n \log s}))\$. In particular this yields a \$\Sigma \Pi \Sigma\$ circuit of size \$\exp(O(\sqrt{d} \cdot \log d))\$ computing the \$d \times d\$ determinant \$\mathsf{Det}\\_d\$. It also means that if we can prove a lower bound of \$\exp(\omega(\sqrt{d} \cdot \log d))\$ on the size of any \$\Sigma \Pi \Sigma\$ circuit computing the \$d \times d\$ permanent \$\mathsf{Perm}\\_d\$, then we get superpolynomial lower bounds for the size of any arithmetic branching program computing \$\mathsf{Perm}\\_d\$. We then give some further results pertaining to derandomizing polynomial identity testing and circuit lower bounds. The \$\Sigma \Pi \Sigma \$ circuits that we construct have the property that (some of) the intermediate polynomials have degree much higher than \$d\$. Indeed such a counterintuitive construction is unavoidable---it is known that in any \$\Sigma \Pi \Sigma\$ circuit \$C\$ computing either \$\mathsf{Det}\\_d\$ or \$\mathsf{Perm}\\_d\$, if every multiplication gate has fanin at most \$d\$ (or any constant multiple thereof), then \$C\$ must have size at least \$\exp(\Omega(d))\$.",
