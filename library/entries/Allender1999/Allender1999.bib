	Abstract = {We characterize the complexity of some natural and important problems in linear algebra. In particular, we identify natural complexity classes for which the problems of (a) determining if a system of linear equations is feasible and (b) computing the rank of an integer matrix (as well as other problems) are complete under logspace reductions.{\textparagraph}As an important part of presenting this classification, we show that the ``exact counting logspace hierarchy'' collapses to near the bottom level. We review the definition of this hierarchy below. We further show that this class is closed under NC1-reducibility, and that it consists of exactly those languages that have logspace uniform span programs (introduced by Karchmer and Wigderson) over the rationals.{\textparagraph}In addition, we contrast the complexity of these problems with the complexity of determining if a system of linear equations has an integer solution.},
