	Abstract = {Real-time software runs over real-time operating systems, and guaranteeing qualities are difficult. In this paper, we propose timed weak simulation relation verification and apply it to a refinement design method of real-time software. Moreover, we apply our proposed method to general real-time software scheduled by fixed-priority preemptive policy.},
