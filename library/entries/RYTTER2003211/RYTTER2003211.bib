  Abstract      = "We introduce new type of context-free grammars, AVL-grammars, and show their applicability to grammar-based compression. Using this type of grammars we present O(nlog|Σ|) time and O(logn)-ratio approximation of minimal grammar-based compression of a given string of length n over an alphabet Σ and O(klogn) time transformation of LZ77 encoding of size k into a grammar-based encoding of size O(klogn). A preliminary version of this paper has been presented in Rytter (Combinatorial Pattern Matching, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 2373, Springer, Berlin, June 2000, pp. 20--31), independently of Charikar et al. (STOC, 2002), where grammar-based approximation has been attacked with different construction and a more complicated type of grammars (α-balanced grammars for α⩽1−122). The AVL-grammar is a very natural and simple tool for grammar based compression, it is a straightforward extension of the classical AVL-tree.",
