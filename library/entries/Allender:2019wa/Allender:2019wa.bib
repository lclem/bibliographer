  Abstract      = "Cost register automata (CRAs) are one-way finite automata whose transitions have the side effect that a register is set to the result of applying a state-dependent semiring operation to a pair of registers. Here it is shown that CRAs over the tropical semiring {\$}({$\backslash$}mathbb {\{}N{\}}{$\backslash$}cup {$\backslash$}{\{}{$\backslash$}infty {$\backslash$}{\}},{$\backslash$}min ,+){\$}can simulate polynomial time computation, proving along the way that a naturally defined width-k circuit value problem over the tropical semiring is {\$}{$\backslash$}textsf {\{}P{\}}{\$}-complete. Then the copyless variant of the CRA, requiring that semiring operations be applied to distinct registers, is shown no more powerful than {\$}{$\backslash$}textsf {\{}NC{\}}\^{}{\{}1{\}}{\$}when the semiring is {\$}({$\backslash$}mathbb {\{}Z{\}},+,{$\backslash$}times ){\$}or {\$}({\{}{$\backslash$}Gamma {\}}\^{}{\{}*{\}}{$\backslash$}cup {$\backslash$}{\{}{$\backslash$}bot {$\backslash$}{\}},{$\backslash$}max ,{$\backslash$}text {\{}concat{\}}){\$}. This relates questions left open in recent work on the complexity of CRA-computable functions to long-standing class separation conjectures in complexity theory, such as {\$}{$\backslash$}textsf {\{}NC{\}}{\$}versus {\$}{$\backslash$}textsf {\{}P{\}}{\$}and NC1 versus GapNC1.",
