  Abstract      = "We produce exact cubic analogues of Jacobi's celebrated theta function identity and of the arithmetic-geometric mean iteration of Gauss and Legendre. The iteration in question is $$a\_{n+1}: = \frac{a\_n + 2b\_n}{3} \text \,{and} b\_{n+1}: = \root 3 \of {b\_n \Bigg(\frac{a^2\_n + a\_nb\_n + b^2\_n}{3}\Bigg)}$$. The limit of this iteration is identified in terms of the hypergeometric function $\_2 F\_1(1/3, 2/3; 1; \cdot)$, which supports a particularly simple cubic transformation.",
