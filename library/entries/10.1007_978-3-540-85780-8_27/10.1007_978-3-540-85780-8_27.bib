  Abstract      = "We give an O(n{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}t) time algorithm to determine whether an NFA with n states and t transitions accepts a language of polynomial or exponential growth. Given a NFA accepting a language of polynomial growth, we can also determine the order of polynomial growth in O(n{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}t) time. We also give polynomial time algorithms to solve these problems for context-free grammars.",
