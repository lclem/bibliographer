	Abstract = {We establish that the finite set of obstructions of a minor-closed set of graphs given by a hyperedge replacement grammar can be effectively constructed. Our proof uses an auxiliary result stating that the system of equations associated with a proper hyperedge replacement grammar has a unique solution.},
