	Abstract = {The relationship between counting functions and logical expressibility is explored. The most well studied class of counting functions is \#P, which consists of the functions counting the accepting computation paths of a nondeterministic polynomial-time Turing machine. For a logicL, \#Lis the class of functions on finite structures counting the tuples (T, ) satisfying a given formulaψ(T, ) inL. Saluja, Subrahmanyam, and Thakur showed that on classes of ordered structures \#FO=\#P (where FO denotes first-order logic) and that every function in \#Σ1has a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme. We give a probabilistic criterion for membership in \#Σ1. A consequence is that functions counting the number of cliques, the number of Hamilton cycles, and the number of pairs with distance greater than two in a graph, are not contained in \#Σ1. It is shown that on ordered structures \#Σ11captures the previously studied class spanP. On unordered structures \#FO is a proper subclass of \#P and \#Σ11is a proper subclass of spanP; in fact, no class \#Lcontains all polynomial-time computable functions on unordered structures. However, it is shown that on unordered structures every function in \#P is identical almost everywhere with some function \#FO, and similarly for \#Sgr;11and spanP. Finally, we discuss the closure properties of \#FO under arithmetical operations.},
