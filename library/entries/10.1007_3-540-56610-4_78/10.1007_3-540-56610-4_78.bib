	Abstract = {Higher-order patterns are simply typed $\lambda$-terms in $\eta$-long form where free variables F only occur in the form F(x1,...,xk) with x1, ...,xkbeing distinct bound variables. It has been proved in [6] that in the simply typed $\lambda$-calculus unification of higher-order patterns modulo $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\eta$ reductions is decidable and unifiable higher-order patterns have a most general unifier.},
