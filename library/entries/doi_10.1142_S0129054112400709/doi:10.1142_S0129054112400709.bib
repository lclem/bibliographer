	Abstract = {The Parikh finite word automaton model (PA) was introduced and studied by Klaedtke and Rue{\ss}. Here, we present some expressiveness properties of a restriction of the deterministic affine PA recently introduced, and use them as a tool to show that the bounded languages recognized by PA are the same as those recognized by deterministic PA. Moreover, this class of languages is shown equal to the class of bounded languages with a semilinear iteration set.},
