  Abstract      = "We show that the existential theory of free partially commutative monoids with involution is decidable. As a consequence the existential theory of graph groups is also decidable. If the underlying alphabet of generators is fixed, we obtain a PSPACE-completeness result, otherwise (in the uniform setting) our decision procedure is in EXPSPACE. Our proof is a reduction to the main result of [6].",
