	Abstract = {Elimination theory is central in differential and difference algebra. The Wu-Ritt characteristic set method, the resultant and the Chow form are three fundamental tools in the elimination theory for algebraic differential or difference equations. In this paper, the authors mainly present a survey of the existing work on the theory of characteristic set methods for differential and difference systems, the theory of differential Chow forms, and the theory of sparse differential and difference resultants.},
