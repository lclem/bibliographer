	Abstract = {The family, L(INDLIN), of languages generated by linear indexed grammars has been studied in the literature. It is known that the Parikh image of every language in L(INDLIN) is semi-linear. However, there are bounded semi-linear languages that are not in L(INDLIN). Here, we look at larger families of (restricted) indexed languages and study their combinatorial and decidability properties, and their relationships.},
