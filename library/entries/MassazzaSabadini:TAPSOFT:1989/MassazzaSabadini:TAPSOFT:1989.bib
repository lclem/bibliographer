  Abstract      = "In this paper we apply generating functions techniques to the problem of deciding whether two probabilistic finite state asynchronous automata define the same events. We prove that the problem can be solved by an efficient parallel algorithm, in particular showing that it is in the class DET. Furthermore, we develop some methods for studying properties of generating functions, in particular from the point of view of the algebricity.",
