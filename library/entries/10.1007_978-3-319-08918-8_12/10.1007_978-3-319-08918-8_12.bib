	Abstract = {We give a coinductive proof of confluence, up to equivalence of root-active subterms, of infinitary lambda-calculus. We also show confluence of B{\"o}hm reduction (with respect to root-active terms) in infinitary lambda-calculus. In contrast to previous proofs, our proof makes heavy use of coinduction and does not employ the notion of descendants.},
