	Abstract = {In this paper we introduce and study Event-Clock Nested Automata (ECNA), a formalism that combines Event Clock Automata (ECA) and Visibly Pushdown Automata (VPA). ECNA allow to express real-time properties over non-regular patterns of recursive programs. We prove that ECNA retain the closure and decidability properties of ECA and VPA being closed under Boolean operations and having a decidable language-inclusion problem. In particular, we prove that emptiness, universality, and language-inclusion for ECNA are Exptime-complete problems. As for the expressiveness, we have that ECNA properly extend any previous attempt in the literature of combining ECA and VPA.},
