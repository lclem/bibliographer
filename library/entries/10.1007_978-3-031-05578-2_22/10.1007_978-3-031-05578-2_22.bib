  Abstract      = "A language L is said to be C-measurable, where C is a class of languages, if there is an infinite sequence of languages in C that converges to L. In this paper we investigate the measuring power of LT the class of all locally testable languages. Although each locally testable language only can check some local property (prefix, suffix, and infix of some bounded length), it is shown that many non-locally-testable languages are LT-measurable. In particular, we show that the measuring power of locally testable languages coincides with the measuring power of unambiguous polynomials. We also examine the measuring power of some fragments of unambiguous polynomials.",
