  Abstract      = "This is a personal survey about pointlike sets since their inception to roughly the present. Personal means that I make no attempt to be exhaustive, but rather to highlight things that have affected my research in the area or that I consider fundamental to the area. Pointlike sets, in the language of separation and covering problems, have become very popular now in Computer Science because of the truly amazing work of Place and Zeitoun on dot-depth and related hierarchies. I believe revisiting some of the older results will revive interest and provide perspective.",
