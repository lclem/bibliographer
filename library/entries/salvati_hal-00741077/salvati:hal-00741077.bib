  Abstract      = "{We propose a model-based approach to the model checking problem for recursive schemes. Since simply typed lambda calculus with the fixpoint operator, lambda-Y-calculus, is equivalent to schemes, we propose to use a model of lambda-Y to discriminate the terms that satisfy a given property. If a model is finite in every type, this gives a decision procedure. We provide a construction of such a model for every property expressed by automata with trivial acceptance conditions and divergence testing. We argue that having a model capable of recognizing terms satisfying a given property has other benefits than just providing decidability of the model-checking problem. We show a very simple construction transforming a scheme to a scheme reflecting a given property.}",
