  Abstract      = "In the early years of the twentieth century, the so-called `postulate analysis'---the study of systems of axioms for mathematical objects for their own sake---was regarded by some as a vital part of the efforts to understand those objects. I consider the place of postulate analysis within early twentieth-century mathematics by focusing on the example of a group: I outline the axiomatic studies to which groups were subjected at this time and consider the changing attitudes towards such investigations.",
