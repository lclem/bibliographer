	Abstract = {It is shown that the intuitionistic propositional calculus is sound and complete with respect to Kripke-style models that are not quasi-ordered. These models, called rudimentary Kripke models, differ from the ordinary intuitionistic Kripke models by making fewer assumptions about the underlying frames, but have the same conditions for valuations. However, since accessibility between points in the frames need not be reflexive, we have to assume, besides the usual intuitionistic heredity, the converse of heredity, which says that if a formula holds in all points accessible to a point x, then it holds in x. Among frames of rudimentary Kripke models, particular attention is paid to those that guarantee that the assumption of heredity and converse heredity for propositional variables implies heredity and converse heredity for all propositional formulae. These frames need to be neither reflexive nor transitive.},
