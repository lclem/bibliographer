	Abstract = {We consider the problem of deciding the existence of real roots of real-valued exponential polynomials with algebraic coefficients. Such functions arise as solutions of linear differential equations with real algebraic coefficients. We focus on two problems: the Zero Problem, which asks whether an exponential polynomial has a real root, and the Infinite Zeros Problem, which asks whether such a function has infinitely many real roots. Our main result is that for differential equations of order at most 8 the Zero Problem is decidable, subject to Schanuel's Conjecture, whilst the Infinite Zeros Problem is decidable unconditionally. We show moreover that a decision procedure for the Infinite Zeros Problem at order 9 would yield an algorithm for computing the Lagrange constant of any given real algebraic number to arbitrary precision, indicating that it will be very difficult to extend our decidability results to higher orders.},
