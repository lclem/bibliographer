  Abstract      = "We present two constructive proofs of the decidability of intuitionistic propositional logic by simultaneously constructing either a counter-model or a derivation. From these proofs, we extract two programs which have a sequent as input and return a derivation or a counter-model. The search tree of these algorithms is linearly bounded by the number of connectives of the input. Soundness of these programs follows from giving a correct construction of the derivations, similarly to Hudelmaier's work [7]; completeness from giving a correct construction of the counter-models, inspired by Miglioli, Moscato, and Ornaghi [8].",
