  Abstract      = "For any univariate polynomial with coefficients in a differential field of characteristic zero and any integer, q, there exists an associated nonzero linear ordinary differential equation (LODE) with the following two properties. Each term of the LODE lies in the differential field generated by the rational numbers and the coefficients of the polynomial, and the qth power of each root of the polynomial is a solution of this LODE. This LODE is called a qth power resolvent of the polynomial. We will show how one can get a resolvent for the logarithmic derivative of the roots of a polynomial from the αth power resolvent of the polynomial, where α is an indeterminate that takes the place of q. We will demonstrate some simple relations among the algebraic and differential equations for the roots and their logarithmic derivatives. We will also prove several theorems regarding linear relations of roots of a polynomial over constants or the coefficient field of the polynomial depending upon the (nondifferential) Galois group. Finally, we will use a differential resolvent to solve the Riccati equation.",
