	Abstract = {We carefully reexamine a construction of Karakostas, Lipton, and Viglas (2003) to show that the intersection non-emptiness problem for DFA's (deterministic finite automata) characterizes the complexity class NL. In particular, if restricted to a binary work tape alphabet, then there exist constants c1 and c2 such that for every k intersection non-emptiness for k DFA's is solvable in c1k log(n) space, but is not solvable in c2k log(n) space. We optimize the construction to show that for an arbitrary number of DFA's intersection non-emptiness is not solvable in {\$}o({\backslash}frac{\{}n{\}}{\{}{\backslash}log(n){\backslash}log({\backslash}log(n)){\}}){\$}space. Furthermore, if there exists a function f(k){\thinspace}={\thinspace}o(k) such that for every k intersection non-emptiness for k DFA's is solvable in nf(k) time, then P â‰  NL. If there does not exist a constant c such that for every k intersection non-emptiness for k DFA's is solvable in nctime, then P does not contain any space complexity class larger than NL.},
