  Abstract      = "We study the power of deterministic successor RAM's with extra instructions like +,*,⋎ and the associated classes of problems decidable in polynomial time. Our main results are NP ... PTIME (+,*,⋎) and PTIME(+,*) ... RP, where RP denotes the class of problems randomly decidable (by probabilistic TM's) in polynomial time.",
