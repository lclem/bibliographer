	Abstract = {One of the open questions about the modal mu-calculus is whether the alternation hierarchy collapses; that is, whether all modal fixpoint properties can be expressed with only a few alternations of least and greatest fixpoints. In this paper, we resolve this question by showing that the hierarchy does not collapse.},
