	Abstract = {We define well-partial-orderings on abstract algebras and give their order types. For every ordinal in an initial segment of the Bachmann hierarchy there is one and only one (up to isomorphism) algebra giving the ordinal as order type. As a corollary, we show Kruskal-type theorems for various structures are equivalent to well-orderedness of certain ordinals.},
