	Abstract = {Finite state transducers over semigroups can be regarded as a formal model of sequential reactive programs. In this paper we introduce a uniform technique for checking effectively functionality, k-valuedness, equivalence and inclusion for this model of computation in the case when a semigroup these transducers operate over is embeddable in a decidable group.},
