  Abstract      = "Given a squarefree polynomial Pâˆˆk0[ x,y ], k0a number field, we construct a linear differential operator that allows one to calculate the genus of the complex curve defined by P= 0 (when P is absolutely irreducible), the absolute factorization of P over the algebraic closure of k0, and calculate information concerning the Galois group of P over \_\_\_ k0(x) as well as overk0 (x).",
