	Abstract = {Population protocols (Angluin et al. in PODC, 2004) are a formal model of sensor networks consisting of identical mobile devices. Two devices can interact and thereby change their states. Computations are infinite sequences of interactions satisfying a strong fairness constraint. A population protocol is well specified if for every initial configuration C of devices, and every computation starting at C, all devices eventually agree on a consensus value depending only on C. If a protocol is well specified, then it is said to compute the predicate that assigns to each initial configuration its consensus value. While the computational power of well-specified protocols has been extensively studied, the two basic verification problems remain open: Is a given protocol well specified? Does a given protocol compute a given predicate? We prove that both problems are decidable by reduction to the reachability problem of Petri nets. We also give a new proof of the fact that the predicates computed by well-defined protocols are those definable in Presburger arithmetic (Angluin et al. in PODC, 2006).},
