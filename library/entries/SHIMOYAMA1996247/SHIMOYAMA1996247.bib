	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new method for primary decomposition of a polynomial ideal, not necessarily zero-dimensional, and report on a detailed study for its practical implementation. In our method, we introduce two key techniques,effective localizationandfast elimination of redundant components, by which we can get a good performance for several examples. The performance of our method is examined by comparison with other existing methods based on practical experiments.},
