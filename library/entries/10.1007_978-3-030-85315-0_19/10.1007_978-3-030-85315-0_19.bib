  Abstract      = "The realizability problem for a given specification {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}S{\}}{\$}{\$}Sis to decide whether there exists an implementation satisfying {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}S{\}}{\$}{\$}S. Although the problem is important in the field of reactive synthesis of recursive programs, the problem has not been studied yet when specification and implementation are given by pushdown computational models. This paper investigates the realizability problem for the cases that a specification and an implementation are given by a pushdown automaton (PDA) and a pushdown transducer (PDT), and a register pushdown automata (RPDA) and a register pushdown transducer (RPDT).",
