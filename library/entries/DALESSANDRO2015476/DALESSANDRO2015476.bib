  Abstract      = "Given two subsets S1,S2 of Nk, we say that S1 is commutatively equivalent to S2 if there exists a bijection f:S1⟶S2 from S1 onto S2 such that, for every v∈S1, |v|=|f(v)|, where |v| denotes the sum of the components of v. We prove that every semi-linear set of Nk is commutatively equivalent to a recognizable subset of Nk.",
