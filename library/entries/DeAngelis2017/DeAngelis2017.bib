	Abstract = {We present an operational semantics for time-aware business processes, that is, processes modeling the execution of business activities, whose durations are subject to linear constraints over the integers. We assume that some of the durations are controllable, that is, they can be determined by the organization that enacts the process, while others are uncontrollable, that is, they are determined by the external world.},
