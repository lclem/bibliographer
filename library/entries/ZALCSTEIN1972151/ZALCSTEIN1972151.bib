  Abstract      = "This paper studies the locally testable languages (or ``events'') introduced by McNaughton and Papert. We characterize these languages by means of their syntactic semigroups and obtain wreath product and direct product decompositions for these semigroups. As a by-product of our study, we find an algebraic characterization of A. Ginzburg's generalized definite languages.",
