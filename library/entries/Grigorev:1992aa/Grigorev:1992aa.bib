  Abstract      = "This article presents an algorithm for elimination of quantifiers in the theory of first-order ordinary differentially closed fields; the algorithm has elementary complexity. The previously known algorithm, due to A. Seidenberg, is of non-elementary complexity. In the description of the algorithm an important procedure is construction of a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of a family of polynomials in one variable with parametric coefficients. The GCD is itself a polynomial in several variables.",
