  Abstract      = "In the last decade Alur and Dill introduced a model of automata on timed ω-sequences which extends the traditional models of finite automata. In this paper we present a theory of timed ω-trees which extends both the theory of timed ω-sequences and the theory of ω-trees. Main motivation is to introduce a new way of specifying real-time systems and provide tools for studying decidability problems in the field of quantitative temporal logics. We study properties and decision problems of the obtained classes of timed ω-tree languages. Our main result is the decidability of the emptiness problem for all the classes of timed ω-tree automata we consider.",
