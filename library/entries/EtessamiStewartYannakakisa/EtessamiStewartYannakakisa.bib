  Abstract      = "We study the problem of computing the probability that a given stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG), G, generates a string in a given regular language L(D) (given by a DFA, D). This basic problem has a number of applications in statistical natural language processing, and it is also a key necessary step towards quantitative \omega-regular model checking of stochastic context-free processes (equivalently, 1-exit recursive Markov chains, or stateless probabilistic pushdown processes).",
