  Abstract      = "Automata for unranked trees form a foundation for \{XML\} Schemas, querying and pattern languages. We study the problem of efficiently minimizing such automata. First, we study unranked tree automata that are standard in database theory, assuming bottom-up determinism and that horizontal recursion is represented by deterministic finite automata. We show that minimal automata in that class are not unique and that minimization is np-complete. Second, we study more recent automata classes that do allow for polynomial time minimization. Among those, we show that bottom-up deterministic stepwise tree automata yield the most succinct representations. Third, we investigate abstractions of \{XML\} schema languages. In particular, we show that the class of one-pass preorder typeable schemas allows for polynomial time minimization and unique minimal models.",
