	Abstract = {LetG andG 0 be context-free grammars. Necessary and sufficient conditions onG 0 are obtained for the decidability ofL(G 0) \$\$ {\backslash}subseteq \$\$ L((G) It is also shown that it is undecidable for whichG 0,L(G) \$\$ {\backslash}subseteq \$\$ is decidable. Furthermore, given thatL(G) \$\$ {\backslash}subseteq \$\$ is decidable for a fixedG 0, there is no effective procedure to determine the algorithm which decidesL(G) \$\$ {\backslash}subseteq \$\$ IfL(G 0) is a regular set,L(G) = L(G 0) is decidable if and only ifL(G 0) is bounded. However, there exist non-regular, unboundedL(G 0) for whichL(G) = L(G 0) is decidable.},
