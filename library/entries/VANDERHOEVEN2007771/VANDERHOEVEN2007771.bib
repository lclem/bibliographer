  Abstract      = "Let Θ=C[e−x1,{\ldots},e−xn][∂1,{\ldots},∂n] and S=C[x1,{\ldots},xn][[eCx1+⋯+Cxn]], where C is an effective field and x1N⋯xnNeCx1+⋯+Cxn and S are given a suitable asymptotic ordering ≼. Consider the mapping L:S→Sl;f↦(L1f,{\ldots},Llf), where L1,{\ldots},Ll∈Θ. For g=(g1,{\ldots},gl)∈SLl=imL, it is natural to ask how to solve the system Lf=g. In this paper, we will effectively characterize SLl and show how to compute a so called distinguished right inverse L−1:SLl→S of L. We will also characterize the solution space of the homogeneous equation Lh=0.",
