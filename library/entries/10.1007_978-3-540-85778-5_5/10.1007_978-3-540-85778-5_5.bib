  Abstract      = "Concavely-priced timed automata, a generalization of linearly-priced timed automata, are introduced. Computing the minimum value of a number of cost functions---including reachability price, discounted price, average time, average price, price-per-time average, and price-per-reward average---is considered in a uniform fashion for concavely-priced timed automata. All the corresponding decision problems are shown to be PSPACE-complete. This paper generalises the recent work of Bouyer et al. on deciding the minimum reachability price and the minimum ratio-price for linearly-priced timed automata.",
