  Abstract      = "We define a class of derivations on the algebra of the non-commutative power series in two variables and study the structure of the Lie algebra generated by them. After detecting the corresponding automorphisms under the exponential map explicitly, we clarify the structure of the automorphism group by means of the Hausdorff group associated to the Lie algebra.",
