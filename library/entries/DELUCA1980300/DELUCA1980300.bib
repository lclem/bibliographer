	Abstract = {A syntactic characterization of strictly locally testable languages is given by means of the concept of constant. If S is a semigroup and X a subset of S, an element c of S is called constant for X if for all p, q, r, s ε S1 *[pcq, rcs εX ⇒ pcs ε X]. The main result of the paper states that a recognizable subset X of a free semigroup A+ is strictly locally testable if and only if all the idempotents of the syntactic semigroup S(X) of X are constants for X′ = XΦ, where Φ: A+ → S(X) is the syntactic morphism. By this result some remarkable consequences are derived for recognizable subsemigroups of A+. In particular we prove that if X is a recognizable free subsemigroup of A+ and Y = X/X2 its base then the following conditions are equivalent : (1) X is strictly locally testable. (2) X is locally testable. (3) X is locally parsable and Y is strictly locally testable. (4) X has a bounded synchronization delay and Y is strictly locally testable (5) A positive integer k exists such that all the elements of A+ whose length is greater than or equal to k, are constants for X. (6) For all the idempotents e of the syntactic semigroup S(X) of X, eS(X)e ⊆ e, 0.},
