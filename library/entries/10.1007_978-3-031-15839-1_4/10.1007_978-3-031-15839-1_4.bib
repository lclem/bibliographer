	Abstract = {We consider the problem of timed channel coding: given two timed languages, can we transmit the information produced by the first, used as information source, as words of the second, used as communication channel? More precisely, we look at coding with bounded delay: having a uniform bound between the timed length of any word from the source and its encoding on the channel. Moreover, we consider approximated coding satisfying the following property: whenever the channel word is observed with precision {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varepsilon '{\$}{\$}$\epsilon${\textasciiacutex}, then the original word can be recovered with precision {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varepsilon {\$}{\$}$\epsilon$.},
