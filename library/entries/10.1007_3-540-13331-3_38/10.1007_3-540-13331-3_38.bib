	Abstract = {Smullyan [61] introduced the class R of rudimentary relations as the smallest class which contains the concatenation relation and which is closed under the boolean operations, explicit transformations and linearly bounded quantification. RUD, the class of rudimentary languages, consists of the sequential encodings of rudimentary relations. Wrathall [75] has shown that RUD can be described as the union LH of a linear time analogue of the polynomial time hierarchy of PH of Meyer,Stockmeyer [72].},
