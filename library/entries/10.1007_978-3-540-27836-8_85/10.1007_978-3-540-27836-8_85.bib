	Abstract = {We give a simple formulation of Karr's algorithm for computing all affine relationships in affine programs. This simplified algorithm runs in time {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}O{\}}(nk^{\{}3{\}}){\$}where n is the program size and k is the number of program variables assuming unit cost for arithmetic operations. This improves upon the original formulation by a factor of k. Moreover, our re-formulation avoids exponential growth of the lengths of intermediately occurring numbers (in binary representation) and uses less complicated elementary operations. We also describe a generalization that determines all polynomial relations up to degree d in time {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}O{\}}(nk^{\{}3d{\}}){\$}.},
