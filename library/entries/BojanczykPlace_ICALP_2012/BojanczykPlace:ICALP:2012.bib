	Abstract = {In this paper, we study boolean (not necessarily positive) combinations of open sets. In other words, we study positive boolean combinations of safety and reachability conditions. We give an algorithm, which inputs a regular language of infinite trees, and decides if the language is a boolean combination of open sets.},
