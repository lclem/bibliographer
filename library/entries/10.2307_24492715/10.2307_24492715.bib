  Abstract      = "In a polynomial ring K[X1,..., Xn] over a field, let I0 ⊂ I1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ Is be a strictly ascending chain of ideals, with the contition that every Ii can be generated by elements of degree not greater than f(i). A. Seidenberg showed that there is a bound on the length s of such a chain depending only on n and f, which is recursive in f for every n and primitive recursive in f for n = 2. In this paper we give a better bound, expressed in a rather simple way in terms of f, which is attained when f is an increasing function. We prove that it is primitive recursive in f for all n. We also show that, on the contrary, there is no bound which is primitive recursive in n in general.",
