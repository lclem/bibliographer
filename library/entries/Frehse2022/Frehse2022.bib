  Abstract      = "We present a collection of advances in the algorithmic verification of hybrid automata with piecewise linear derivatives, so-called Linear Hybrid Automata. New ways to represent and compute with polyhedra, in combination with heuristic algorithmic improvements, have led to considerable speed-ups in checking safety properties through set propagation. We also showcase a CEGAR-style approach that iteratively constructs a polyhedral abstraction. We illustrate the efficiency and scalability of both approaches with two sets of benchmarks.",
