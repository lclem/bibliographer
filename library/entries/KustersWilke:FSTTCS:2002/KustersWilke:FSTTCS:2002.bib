  Abstract      = "We show that the following problem is decidable and complete for deterministic exponential time. Given a formula of modal $\mu$- calculus, determine if the formula is equivalent to a formula without greatest fixed point operators. In other words, we show that the first level of the $\mu$-calculus fixed point alternation hierarchy is decidable in deterministic exponential time.",
