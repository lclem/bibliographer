	Abstract = {We establish strong connections between the non-emptiness of intersection problem for two and three DFA's over a binary alphabet and the triangle finding and 3sum problems. In particular, we introduce efficient reductions from triangle finding to non-emptiness of intersection for two DFA's over a binary alphabet and from 3sum to non-emptiness of intersection for three DFA's over a binary alphabet. Additionally, in our main result, we show that for every {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha {\backslash}ge 2{\$}{\$}, non-emptiness of intersection for three DFA's over a unary alphabet can be solved in {\$}{\$}O(n^{\{}{\backslash}frac{\{}{\backslash}alpha {\}}{\{}2{\}}{\}}){\$}{\$}time if and only if triangle finding can be solved in {\$}{\$}O(n^{\{}{\backslash}alpha {\}}){\$}{\$}time.},
