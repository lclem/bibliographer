  Abstract      = {Chomsky and Sch{\"u}tzenberger showed in 1963 that the sequence dL(n), which counts the number of words of a given length n in a regular language L, satisfies a linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients for n, or equivalently, the generating function {\$}g{\\_}L(x)={\backslash}sum{\\_}{\{}n{\}} d{\\_}L(n) x^n{\$}is a rational function. In this talk we survey results concerning sequences a(n) of natural numbers which satisfy linear recurrence relations over ℤ or ℤm, andhave a combinatorial or logical interpretation.},
