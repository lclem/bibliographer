	Abstract = {We investigate the problem of computing the partition function of a probabilistic context-free grammar, and consider a number of applicable methods. Particular attention is devoted to PCFGs that result from the intersection of another PCFG and a finite automaton. We report experiments involving the Wall Street Journal corpus.},
