  Abstract      = "We investigate languages recognized by well structured transition systems (WSTS) with upward (resp. downward) compatibility. We show that under mild assumptions every two disjoint WSTS languages are regular separable, i.e., there exists a regular language containing one of them and disjoint from the other. In particular, if a language, as well as its complement, are both recognized by a WSTS, then they are necessarily regular.",
