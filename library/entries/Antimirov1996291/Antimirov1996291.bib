	Abstract = {We introduce a notion of partial derivative of a regular expression and apply it to finite automaton constructions. The notion is a generalization of the known notion of word derivative due to Brzozowski: partial derivatives are related to non-deterministic finite automata (NFA's) in the same natural way as derivatives are related to deterministic ones (DFA's). We give a constructive definition of partial derivatives and prove several facts, in particular: 1. (1) any derivative of a regular expression r can be represented by a finite set of partial derivatives of r; 2. (2) the set of all partial derivatives of r is finite and its cardinality is less than or equal to one plus the number of occurrences of letters from A appearing in r; 3. (3) any partial derivative of r is either a regular unit, or a subterm of r, or a concatenation of several such subterms. These theoretical results lead us to a new algorithm for turning regular expressions into relatively small NFA's and allow us to provide certain improvements to Brzozowski's algorithm for constructing DFA's. We also report on a prototype implementation of our \{NFA\} construction and present several examples.},
