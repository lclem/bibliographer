  Abstract      = "The problem of finding regularity conditions for languages is, via the syntactic monoid, closely related to the classical Burnside problem. This survey paper presents several results and conjectures in this direction as well as on related subjects, including bounded languages, pumping, square-free words, commutativity, and rational power series.",
