  Abstract      = "We study the complexity of representing polynomials by arithmeticcircuits in both the commutative and the non-commutative settings.Our approach goes through a precise understanding of the morerestricted setting where multiplication is not associative, meaningthat we distinguish (xy)z from x(yz).",
