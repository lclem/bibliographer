	Abstract = {We introduce a new formalism called automata over a timed domain which provides an adequate framework for the determinization of timed systems. In this formalism, determinization w.r.t. timed language is always possible at the cost of changing the timed domain. We give a condition for determinizability of automata over a timed domain without changing the timed domain, which allows us to recover several known determinizable classes of timed systems, such as strongly-non-zeno timed automata, integer-reset timed automata, perturbed timed automata, etc. Moreover in the case of timed automata this condition encompasses most determinizability conditions from the literature.},
