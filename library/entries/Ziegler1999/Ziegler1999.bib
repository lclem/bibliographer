  Abstract      = "`Integer programming' is a basic mathematical problem, of central importance in Optimization and Operations Research. While a systematic body of theory has been developed for it in the last fifty years [14], it has been realized only very recently, first by Conti {\\&} Traverso [5], that the Buchberger algorithm (cf. Chapter 1) provides a solution strategy for integer programming problems, in particular in the case of families of programs with `varying right hand side'.",
