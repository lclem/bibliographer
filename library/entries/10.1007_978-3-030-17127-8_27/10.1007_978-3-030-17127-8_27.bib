	Abstract = {We devise a variant of Dialectica interpretation of intuitionistic linear logic for , a linear logic-based version {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}MSO{\}}{\$}{\$}over infinite words. was known to be correct and complete w.r.t. Church's synthesis, thanks to an automata-based realizability model. Invoking B{\"u}chi-Landweber Theorem and building on a complete axiomatization of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}MSO{\}}{\$}{\$}on infinite words, our interpretation provides us with a syntactic approach, without any further construction of automata on infinite words. Via Dialectica, as linear negation directly corresponds to switching players in games, we furthermore obtain a complete logic: either a closed formula or its linear negation is provable. This completely axiomatizes the theory of the realizability model of . Besides, this shows that in principle, one can solve Church's synthesis for a given {\$}{\$}{\backslash}forall {\backslash}exists {\$}{\$}-formula by only looking for proofs of either that formula or its linear negation.},
