  Abstract      = "The question of whether a polynomial belongs to a finitely generated differential ideal remains open. This problem is solved only in some particular cases. In the paper, we propose a method, which reduces the test of membership for fractional ideals generated by a composition of differential polynomials to another, simpler, membership problem.",
