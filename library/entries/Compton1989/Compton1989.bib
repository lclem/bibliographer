	Abstract = {This is a survey of logical results concerning random structures. A class of relational structures on which a (finitely additive) probability measure has been defined has a 0--1 law for a particular logic if every sentence of that logic has probability either 0 or 1. The measure may be an asymptotic probability on finite structures or generated on a class of infinite structures by assigning fixed probabilities to independently occurring properties. Conditions under which all sentences of a logic have a probability, and under which 0--1 laws occur, are examined. Also, the complexity of computing probabilities of sentences is considered.},
