  Abstract      = "Let S be a subset of the signature of relation algebra. Let R(S) be the closure under isomorphism of the class of proper S-structures and let F(S) be the closure under isomorphism of the class of proper S-structures over finite bases. Based on previous work, we prove that membership of R(S) is undecidable when {\$}{\$}S{\backslash}supseteq {\backslash}{\{}{\backslash}cdot , +, ;{\backslash}{\}},{\backslash}; S{\backslash}supseteq {\backslash}{\{}{\backslash}cdot , {\{}{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}smile {\}}, ;{\backslash}{\}}{\$}{\$}or {\$}{\$}{\{}{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}smile {\}}{\backslash}not {\backslash}in S{\backslash}supseteq {\backslash}{\{}{\backslash}le , -, ;{\backslash}{\}}{\$}{\$}, and for any of these signatures S if converse is excluded from S then membership of F(S) is also undecidable, for finite S-structures.",
