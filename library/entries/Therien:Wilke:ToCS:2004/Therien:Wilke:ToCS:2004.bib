  Abstract      = "We provide an effective characterization of the ``until-since hierarchy''oflinear temporal logic over finite models (strings), that is, we show how tocompute for a given temporal property of strings the minimal nesting depthin ``until''and ``since''required to express it. This settles the mostprominent classification problem for linear temporal logic. Ourcharacterization of the individual levels of the ``until-since hierarchy''is algebraic: for each n, we present a decidable class of finitesemigroups and show that a temporal property is expressible with nestingdepth at most n if and only if the syntactic semigroup of the formallanguage associated with the property belongs to the class provided. Thecore of our algebraic characterization is a new description of substitutionin linear temporal logic in terms of block products of finite semigroups.",
