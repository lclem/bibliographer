  Abstract      = "Abstract Systems of finitely many equations of the form φ ( X 1 , {\ldots} , X n ) = ψ ( X 1 , {\ldots} , X n ) are considered, in which the unknowns X i are sets of natural numbers, while the expressions φ , ψ may contain singleton constants and the operations of union and pairwise addition S + T = { m + n | m ∈ S , n ∈ T } . It is shown that the family of sets representable by unique (least, greatest) solutions of such systems is exactly the family of recursive (r.e., co-r.e., respectively) sets of numbers. Basic decision problems for these systems are located in the arithmetical hierarchy. The same results are established for equations with addition and intersection.",
