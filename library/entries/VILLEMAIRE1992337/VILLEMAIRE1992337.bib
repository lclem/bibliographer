	Abstract = {We first give a simple encoding for k-automata in 〈N, +, Vk〉, where Vk is the function from N⧹{0} to N mapping x to the largest power of k which divides x. This, with a result of Hodgson, gives a proof of B{\"u}chi's theorem, which states that a subset of Nn is k-recognizable by automata if and only if it is definable in 〈N, +, Vk〉. Our proof also shows that every formula of 〈N, +, Vk〉 is equivalent to a ∃∀∃-formula. Furthermore, solving a problem of A. Joyal, we show that the first-order theory of 〈N, +, Vk, Vl〉 is undecidable for k,l multiplicatively independent.},
