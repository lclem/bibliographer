	Abstract = {We develop a novel learning algorithm RTI for identifying a deterministic real-time automaton (DRTA) from labeled time-stamped event sequences. The RTI algorithm is based on the current state of the art in deterministic finite-state automaton (DFA) identification, called evidence-driven state-merging (EDSM). In addition to having a DFA structure, a DRTA contains time constraints between occurrences of consecutive events. Although this seems a small difference, we show that the problem of identifying a DRTA is much more difficult than the problem of identifying a DFA: identifying only the time constraints of a DRTA given its DFA structure is already NP-complete. In spite of this additional complexity, we show that RTI is a correct and complete algorithm that converges efficiently (from polynomial time and data) to the correct DRTA in the limit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that can identify a timed automaton model from time-stamped event sequences.},
