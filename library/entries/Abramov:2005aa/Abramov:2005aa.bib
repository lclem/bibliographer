	Abstract = {We present some algorithms related to rings of Ore polynomials (or, briefly, Ore rings) and describe a computer algebra library for basic operations in an arbitrary Ore ring. The library can be used as a basis for various algorithms in Ore rings, in particular, in differential, shift, and q-shift rings.},
