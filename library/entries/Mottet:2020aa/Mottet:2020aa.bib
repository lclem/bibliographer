	Abstract = {We investigate the complexity of the containment problem ``Does L(A)⊆L(B){\$}L({$\backslash$}mathcal {\{}A{\}}){$\backslash$}subseteq L({\{}{$\backslash$}mathscr{\{}B{\}}{\}}){\$}hold?''for register automata and timed automata, where B{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathscr{\{}B{\}}{\}}{\$}is assumed to be unambiguous and A{\$}{$\backslash$}mathcal {\{}A{\}}{\$}is arbitrary. We prove that the problem is decidable in the case of register automata over (ℕ,=){\$}({$\backslash$}mathbb N,=){\$}, in the case of register automata over (ℚ,<){\$}({$\backslash$}mathbb Q,<){\$}when B{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathscr{\{}B{\}}{\}}{\$}has a single register, and in the case of timed automata when B{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathscr{\{}B{\}}{\}}{\$}has a single clock. We give a 2-EXPSPACE algorithm in the first case, whose complexity is a single exponential in the case that B{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathscr{\{}B{\}}{\}}{\$}has a bounded number of registers. In the other cases, we give an EXPSPACE algorithm.},
