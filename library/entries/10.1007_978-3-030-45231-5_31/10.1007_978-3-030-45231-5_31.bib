	Abstract = {In this paper, we study active learning algorithms for weighted automata over a semiring. We show that a variant of Angluin's seminal {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathtt {\{}L{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}!{\backslash}star {\}}{\$}{\$}Lâ‹†algorithm works when the semiring is a principal ideal domain, but not for general semirings such as the natural numbers.},
