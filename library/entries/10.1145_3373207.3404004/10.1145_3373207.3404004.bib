  Abstract      = "In an earlier paper, the notion of integrality known for algebraic number fields and fields of algebraic functions has been extended to D-finite functions. The aim of the present paper is to extend the notion to the case of P-recursive sequences. In order to do so, we formulate a general algorithm for finding all integral elements for valued vector spaces and then show that this algorithm includes not only the algebraic and the D-finite cases but also covers the case of P-recursive sequences.",
