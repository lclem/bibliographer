  Abstract      = "An algebraic proof is given of the existence of equilibrium points for bimatrix (or two-person, non-zero-sum) games. The proof is constructive, leading to an efficient scheme for computing an equilibrium point. In a nondegenerate case, the number of equilibrium points is finite and odd. The proof is valid for any ordered field.",
