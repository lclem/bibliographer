  Abstract      = "In this paper we prove an exponential lower bound on the size of bounded-depth Frege proofs for the pigeonhole principle (PHP). We also obtain an Î©(loglogn)-depth lower bound for any polynomial-sized Frege proof of the pigeonhole principle. Our theorem nearly completes the search for the exact complexity of the PHP, as S. Buss has constructed polynomial-size, logn-depth Frege proofs for the PHP. The main lemma in our proof can be viewed as a general H{\aa}stad-style Switching Lemma for restrictions that are partial matchings. Our lower bounds for the pigeonhole principle improve on previous superpolynomial lower bounds.",
