  Abstract      = "We present a translation function from nominal rewriting systems (NRSs) to combinatory reduction systems (CRSs), transforming closed nominal rules and ground nominal terms to CRSs rules and terms while preserving the rewriting relation. This result, together with previous translations from CRSs to NRSs and between CRSs and other higher-order rewriting formalisms, opens up the path for a transfer of results between higher-order and nominal rewriting. In particular, techniques and properties of the rewriting relation, such as termination, can be exported from one formalism to the other.",
