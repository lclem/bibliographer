	Abstract = {This note presents a detailed proof of a result in the theory of concurrency semantics that is already considered folklore, namely that branching bisimilarity is an equivalence relation. The ``simple proof'', which in the literature is always assumed to exist, is shown to be incorrect. The proof in this note is based on the notion of a semi-branching bisimulation taken from (Van Glabbeek and Weijland, 1991). Branching bisimilarity can equivalently be defined in terms of semi-branching bisimulations; the results suggest that such a definition is more intuitive than the original definition of Van Glabbeek and Weijland (1989).},
