  Abstract      = "For an $\omega$-word language L, the derived tree language Path(L) is the language of trees having all their paths in L. We consider the hierarchies of deterministic automata on words and nondeterministic automata on trees with Rabin conditions in chain form. We show that L is on some level of the hierarchy of deterministic word automata iff Path(L) is on the same level of the hierarchy of nondeterministic tree automata.",
