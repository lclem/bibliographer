  Abstract      = {Different types of nondeterministic automata on infinite words differ in their succinctness and in the complexity for their nonemptiness problem. A simple translation of a parity automaton to an equivalent B{\"u}chi automaton is quadratic: a parity automaton with n states, m transitions, and index k may result in a B{\"u}chi automaton of size O((n + m)k). The best known algorithm for the nonemptiness problem of parity automata goes through B{\"u}chi automata, leading to a complexity of O((n + m)k). In this paper we show that while the translation of parity automata to B{\"u}chi automata cannot be improved, the special structure of the acceptance condition of parity automata can be used in order to solve the nonemptiness problem directly, with a dynamic graph algorithm of complexity O((n + m) log k).},
