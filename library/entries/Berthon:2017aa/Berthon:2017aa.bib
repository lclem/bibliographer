  Abstract      = "The beyond worst-case synthesis problem was introduced recently by Bruy\`ere et al. [BFRR14]: it aims at building system controllers that provide strict worst-case performance guarantees against an antagonistic environment while ensuring higher expected performance against a stochastic model of the environment. Our work extends the framework of [BFRR14] and follow-up papers, which focused on quantitative objectives, by addressing the case of $\omega$-regular conditions encoded as parity objectives, a natural way to represent functional requirements of systems.",
