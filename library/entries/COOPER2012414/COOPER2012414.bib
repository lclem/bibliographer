  Abstract      = "This paper considers the problem of showing that every pair of binary trees with the same number of leaves parses a common word under a certain simple grammar. We enumerate the common parse words for several infinite families of tree pairs and discuss several ways to reduce the problem of finding a parse word for a pair of trees to that for a smaller pair. The statement that every pair of trees has a common parse word is equivalent to the statement that every planar graph is four-colorable, so the results are a step toward a language theoretic proof of the four color theorem.",
