  Abstract      = "This expository paper, aimed at the reader without much background in set theory or logic, gives an overview of Cohen's proof (via forcing) of the independence of the continuum hypothesis. It emphasizes the broad outlines and the intuitive motivation while omitting most of the proofs. The reader must of course consult standard textbooks for the missing details, but this article provides a map of the forest so that the beginner will not get lost while forging through the trees.",
