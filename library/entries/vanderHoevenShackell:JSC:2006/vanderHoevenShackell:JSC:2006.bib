	Abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the complexity of a zero-test for expressions built from formal power series solutions of first order differential equations with non-degenerate initial conditions. We will prove a doubly exponential complexity bound. This bound establishes a power series analogue for ``witness conjectures''.},
