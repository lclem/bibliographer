	Abstract = {We present ROLL 1.0, an {\$}{\$}{\backslash}omega {\$}{\$}-regular language learning library with command line tools to learn and complement B{\"u}chi automata. This open source Java library implements all existing learning algorithms for the complete class of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}omega {\$}{\$}-regular languages. It also provides a learning-based B{\"u}chi automata complementation procedure that can be used as a baseline for automata complementation research. The tool supports both the Hanoi Omega Automata format and the BA format used by the tool RABIT. Moreover, it features an interactive Jupyter notebook environment that can be used for educational purpose.},
