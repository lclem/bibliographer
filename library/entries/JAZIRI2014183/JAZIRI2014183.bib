	Abstract = {In this paper we develop the metatheory for Timed Modal Logic (TML), which is the modal logic used for the analysis of timed transition systems (TTSs). We solve a series of long-standing open problems related to TML. Firstly, we prove that TML enjoys the Hennessy-Milner property and solve one of the open questions in the field. Secondly, we prove that the set of validities are not recursively enumerable. Nevertheless, we develop a strongly-complete proof system for TML. Since the logic is not compact, the proof system contains infinitary rules, but only with countable sets of instances. Thus, we can involve topological results regarding Stone spaces, such as the Rasiowa-Sikorski lemma, to complete the proofs.},
