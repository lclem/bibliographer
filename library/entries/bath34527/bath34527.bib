  Abstract      = "An explicit-sharing lambda-calculus is presented, based on a Curry-Howard-style interpretation of the deep inference proof formalism. Duplication of subterms during reduction proceeds ?atomically', i.e. on individual constructors, similar to optimal graph reduction in the style of Lamping. The calculus preserves strong normalisation with respect to the lambda-calculus, and achieves fully lazy sharing.",
