	Abstract = {It is shown that if a bound $f(i)$ is placed on the degrees of the elements in some basis of an ideal $A\_i$ in the polynomial ring $k\lbrack X\_i, \cdots, X\_n \rbrack$ over the field $k, i = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$, then a bound can be placed on the length of a strictly ascending chain $A\_0 < A\_1 < \cdots$. Moreover one could explicitly write down a formula for a bound $g\_n$ in terms of $f$ and $n$.},
