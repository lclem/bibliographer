  Abstract      = {The elementary functions of a complex variable z are those functions built up from the rational functions of z by exponentiation, taking logarithms, and algebraic operations. The purpose of this paper is first to prove a "structure theorem" which shows that if an algebraic relation holds among a set of elementary functions, then they must satisfy an algebraic relation of a special kind. Then we make four applications of this theorem, obtaining both new and old results which are described here briefly (and imprecisely).^\ast(1) An algorithm is given for telling when two elementary expressions define the same function. (2) A characterization is derived of those differential equations having elementary solutions. (3) The four basic functions of elementary calculus-exp, log, tan, tan-1-are shown to be "irredundant." (4) A characterization is given of elementary functions possessing elementary inverses.},
