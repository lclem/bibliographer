	Abstract = {The class of reduction-based algorithms was introduced recently as a new approach towards creative telescoping. Starting with Hermite reduction of rational functions, various reductions have been introduced for increasingly large classes of holonomic functions. In this paper we show how to construct reductions for general holonomic functions, in the purely differential setting.},
