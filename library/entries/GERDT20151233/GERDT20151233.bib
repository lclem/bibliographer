  Abstract      = {In this paper we develop a Gr{\"o}bner bases theory for ideals of partial difference polynomials with constant or non-constant coefficients. In particular, we introduce a criterion providing the finiteness of such bases when a difference ideal contains elements with suitable linear leading monomials. This can be explained in terms of Noetherianity of the corresponding quotient algebra. Among these Noetherian quotients we find finitely generated polynomial algebras where the action of suitable finite dimensional commutative algebras and in particular finite abelian groups is defined. We obtain therefore a consistent Gr{\"o}bner bases theory for ideals that possess such symmetries.},
