	Abstract = {Let \$d\\_1 , \cdots ,d\\_n \$ be positive integers. Let \$\mathcal{P}\$ denote the set of systems of polynomials \$f:\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n \$ that have only finitely many zeros, including those ``at infinity,'' and that satisfy degree \$(f\\_i ) = d\\_i \$ for all i. Let \$0 < \varepsilon \leqq R\$. It is shown for fixed \$d\\_1 , \cdots ,d\\_n \$, that with respect to a certain model of computation, the worst-case computational complexity of obtaining \$\varepsilon \$-approximations to at least those zeros \$\xi \$ satisfying \$|\xi | \leqq R\$ for arbitrary \$f \in \mathcal{P}\$ is \$\Theta (\log \log (({ R / \varepsilon }))\$; that is to say, both upper and lower bounds are proved. An algorithm for proving the upper bound is introduced. The number of operations required by this algorithm is \[O\left[ {n\mathcal{D}^4 (\log \mathcal{D})(\log \log ( { R / \varepsilon } )) + n^2 \mathcal{D}^4 \left( \begin{array}{*{20}c} {1 + \Sigma d\\_i} \\ n \\ \end{array} \right)^4 } \right],\quad {\text{where }}\mathcal{D} = \prod\limits\\_{i = 1}^n {d\\_i .} \]},
