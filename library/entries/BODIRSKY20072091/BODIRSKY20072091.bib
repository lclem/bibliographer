  Abstract      = "We show that the number gn of labelled series--parallel graphs on n vertices is asymptotically gn∼g⋅n−5/2γnn!, where γ and g are explicit computable constants. We show that the number of edges in random series--parallel graphs is asymptotically normal with linear mean and variance, and that it is sharply concentrated around its expected value. Similar results are proved for labelled outerplanar graphs and for graphs not containing K2,3 as a minor.",
