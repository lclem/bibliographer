	Abstract = {The intent of this article is to provide a general and elementary account of the model theory of differential fields, collecting together various results (many without proof) and offering a few algebraic details for the logician reader. The first model-theoretic look at differential fields was taken by Abraham Robinson in the context of model completeness, while later developments have served to illustrate concepts developed by Morley and Shelah.},
