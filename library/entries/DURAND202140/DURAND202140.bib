	Abstract = {We introduce a new framework for a descriptive complexity approach to arithmetic computations. We define a hierarchy of classes based on the idea of counting assignments to free function variables in first-order formulae. We completely determine the inclusion structure and show that \#P and \#AC0 appear as classes of this hierarchy. In this way, we unconditionally place \#AC0 properly in a strict hierarchy of arithmetic classes within \#P. Furthermore, we show that some of our classes admit efficient approximation in the sense of FPRAS. We compare our classes with a hierarchy within \#P defined in a model-theoretic way by Saluja et al. and argue that our approach is better suited to study arithmetic circuit classes such as \#AC0 which can be descriptively characterized as a class in our framework.},
