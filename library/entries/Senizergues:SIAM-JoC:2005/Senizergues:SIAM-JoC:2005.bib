	Abstract = {The bisimulation problem for equational graphs of finite out-degree is shown to be decidable. We reduce this problem to the \$\eta\$-bisimulation problem for deterministic rational (vectors of) boolean series on the alphabet of a deterministic pushdown automaton \${\cal M}\$. We then exhibit a complete formal system for deducing equivalent pairs of such vectors.},
