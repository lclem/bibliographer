  Abstract      = "The decidability of the model checking problem for several $\mu$-calculi and Petri nets is analysed. The linear time $\mu$-calculus without atomic sentences is decidable; if simple atomic sentences are added, it becomes undecidable. A very simple subset of the modal $\mu$-calculus is undecidable.",
