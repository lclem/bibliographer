  Abstract      = "We provide translations between process algebra and systems of chemical reactions. We show that the translations preserve discrete-state (stochastic) and continuous-state (concentration) semantics, and in particular that the continuous-state semantics of processes corresponds to the differential equations of chemistry based on the law of mass action. The novel semantics of processes so obtained equates processes that have the same state occupation dynamics, but which may have different interaction interfaces.",
