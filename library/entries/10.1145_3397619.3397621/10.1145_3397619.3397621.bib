	Abstract = {We survey some results about the sequentiality problem for max-plus automata and its generalisation, the register complexity problem for cost register automata. We compare classes of functions computed by maxplus automata and by cost register automata with respect to the notion of ambiguity. The two models are introduced gently, so the novice reader is welcome!},
