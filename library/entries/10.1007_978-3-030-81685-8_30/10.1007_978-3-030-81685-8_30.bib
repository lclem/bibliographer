	Abstract = {Given the versatility of timed automata a huge body of work has evolved that considers extensions of timed automata. One extension that has received a lot of interest is timed automata with a, possibly unbounded, stack, also called pushdown timed automata (PDTA). While different algorithms have been given for reachability in different variants of this model, most of these results are purely theoretical and do not give rise to efficient implementations. One main reason for this is that none of these algorithms (and the implementations that exist) use the so-called zone-based abstraction, but rely either on the region-abstraction or other approaches, which are significantly harder to implement.},
