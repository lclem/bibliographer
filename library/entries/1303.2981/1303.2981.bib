  Abstract      = "We consider higher-dimensional versions of Kannan and Lipton's Orbit Problem---determining whether a target vector space V may be reached from a starting point x under repeated applications of a linear transformation A. Answering two questions posed by Kannan and Lipton in the 1980s, we show that when V has dimension one, this problem is solvable in polynomial time, and when V has dimension two or three, the problem is in NP^{RP}.",
