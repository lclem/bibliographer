	Abstract = {We provide a complete description of the Wadge hierarchy for deterministically recognizable sets of infinite trees. In particular we give an elementary procedure to decide if one deterministic tree language is continuously reducible to another. This extends Wagner's results on the hierarchy of $\omega$-regular languages to the case of trees.},
