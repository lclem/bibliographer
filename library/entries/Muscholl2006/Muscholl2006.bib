	Abstract = {An Active Context-Free Game is a game with two players (ROMEO and JULIET) on strings over a finite alphabet. In each move, JULIET selects a position of the current word and ROMEO rewrites the corresponding letter according to a rule of a context-free grammar. JULIET wins if a string of the regular target language is reached. The complexity of deciding the existence of winning strategies for JULIET is investigated, depending on properties of the grammar and of the target language, and on restrictions on the strategy.},
