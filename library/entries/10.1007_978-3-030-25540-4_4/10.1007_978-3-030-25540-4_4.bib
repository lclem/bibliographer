  Abstract      = {Discounted-sum inclusion (DS-inclusion, in short) formalizes the goal of comparing quantitative dimensions of systems such as cost, resource consumption, and the like, when the mode of aggregation for the quantitative dimension is discounted-sum aggregation. Discounted-sum comparator automata, or DS-comparators in short, are B{\"u}chi automata that read two infinite sequences of weights synchronously and relate their discounted-sum. Recent empirical investigations have shown that while DS-comparators enable competitive algorithms for DS-inclusion, they still suffer from the scalability bottleneck of B{\"u}chi operations.},
