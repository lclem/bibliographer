  Abstract      = "Polynomial Interrupt Timed Automata (PolITA) are finite automata with clocks organized along hierarchical levels. These clocks are equipped with an interruption mechanism, well suited to the modeling of real-time operating systems. Moreover, transitions between states contain polynomial guards and updates. The reachability problem in this class is known to be in 2EXPTIME with a decision procedure based on the cylindrical algebraic decomposition. We improve this complexity to EXPSPACE mainly using a combinatorial argument and we include a reduction leading to a PSPACE lower bound.",
