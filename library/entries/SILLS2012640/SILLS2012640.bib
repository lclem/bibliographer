	Abstract = {The purpose of this short article is to announce, and briefly describe, a Maple package, PARTITIONS, that (inter alia) completely automatically discovers, and then proves, explicit expressions (as sums of quasi-polynomials) for pm(n) for any desired m. We do this to demonstrate the power of ``rigorous guessing'' as facilitated by the quasi-polynomial ansatz.},
