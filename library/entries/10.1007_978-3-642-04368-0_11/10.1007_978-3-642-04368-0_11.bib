	Abstract = {We show that all $\epsilon$-transitions can be removed from timed automata if we allow transitions to be labeled with periodic clock constraints and with periodic clock updates. This utilizes a representation of the reachability relation in timed automata in a generalization of Difference Logic with periodic constraints. We also show that periodic updates are necessary for the removal of $\epsilon$-transitions.},
