	Abstract = {We present an algorithm for finding a minimal set of two-dimensional linear recurring relations capable of generating a prescribed finite two-dimensional array. This is a two-dimensional extension of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm for synthesizing a shortest linear feedback shift-register capable of generating a given finite sequence. The complexity of computation for an array of size n is 0(n2) under some reasonable assumptions. Furthermore, we make clear some relationship between our algorithm and Gr{\"o}bner bases of bivariate polynomial ideals, where polynomials correspond one-to-one to linear recurring relations.},
