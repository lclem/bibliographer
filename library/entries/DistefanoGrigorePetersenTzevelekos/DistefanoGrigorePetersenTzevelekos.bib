  Abstract      = "We introduce a new formal framework aimed at checking temporal safety properties of object-oriented programs. The underpinning theoretical foundations of our framework is an extended class of register automata. As registers' values can be updated, our automata are able to express highly complex properties of systems involving multiple interacting objects. Specifications are then used to instrument Java bytecode so that their violations can be automatically detected at runtime. The tradeoff between the coverage and the overhead of the monitoring system is tunable by means of a number of parameters. We validated our technique by checking several safety properties on large open source projects.",
