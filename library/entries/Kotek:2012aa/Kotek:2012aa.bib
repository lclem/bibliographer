  Abstract      = {Using a theorem of N. Chomsky and M. Sch{\"u}tzenberger one can characterize sequences of integers which satisfy linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients (C-finite sequences) as differences of two sequences counting words in regular languages. We prove an analog for P-recursive (holonomic) sequences in terms of counting certain lattice paths.},
