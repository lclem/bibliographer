  Abstract      = "We study the problem of control synthesis for a timed plant and an external timed specification, modelled as timed automata. Our main result is that the problem is decidable when we are given a priori the resources for the controller (the number of clocks, observational power of clocks, etc.) and when the specification is an $\omega$-regular timed language describing undesired behaviours. We also show that for deterministic specifications, if there is a controller at all, then there is one which uses the combined resources of the plant and specification. The decidability of other related problems is also investigated.",
