  Abstract      = "A register automaton is a finite automaton with finitely many registers ranging from an infinite alphabet. Since the valuations of registers are infinite, there are infinitely many configurations. We describe a technique to classify infinite register automata configurations into finitely many exact representative configurations. Using the finitary representation, we give an algorithm solving the reachability problem for register automata. We moreover define a computation tree logic for register automata and solve its model checking problem.",
