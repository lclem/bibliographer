  Abstract      = "Some applications of linear temporal logic (LTL) require to translate formulae of the logic to deterministic omega-automata. There are currently two translators producing deterministic automata: ltl2dstar working for the whole LTL and Rabinizer applicable to LTL(F,G) which is the LTL fragment using only modalities F and G. We present a new translation to deterministic Rabin automata via alternating automata and deterministic transition-based generalized Rabin automata. Our translation applies to a fragment that is strictly larger than LTL(F,G). Experimental results show that our algorithm can produce significantly smaller automata compared to Rabinizer and ltl2dstar, especially for more complex LTL formulae.",
