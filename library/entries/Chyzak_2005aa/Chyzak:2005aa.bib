	Abstract = {In this paper, we study linear control systems over Ore algebras. Within this mathematical framework, we can simultaneously deal with different classes of linear control systems such as time-varying systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), differential time-delay systems, underdetermined systems of partial differential equations (PDEs), multidimensional discrete systems, multidimensional convolutional codes, etc. We give effective algorithms which check whether or not a linear control system over some Ore algebra is controllable, parametrizable, flat or Ï€-free.},
