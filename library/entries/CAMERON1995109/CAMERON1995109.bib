	Abstract = {This paper is inspired by the paper Some Canonical Sequences of Integers by Bernstein and Sloane. The main observation is that seven of the operators defined in that paper have natural interpretations in terms of counting orbits of groups, providing a pattern which is completed by five further operators. Some of their eigen-sequences also have group-theoretic meaning.},
