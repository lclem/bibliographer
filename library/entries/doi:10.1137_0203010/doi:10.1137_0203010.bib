  Abstract      = "We present specific polynomials in \$\mathbb{C}[x]\$ with algebraic or rational coefficients which are hard to compute (even though arbitrary complex numbers are allowed as inputs for the computation). Examples are: \$\sum\\_{\delta = 0}^d e^{2\pi i/2^\delta } x^\delta \$, \$\sum\\_{\delta = 0}^d 2^{2^\delta } x^\delta \$. We also show that the minimum number of arithmetic operations to compute polynomials in \$\mathbb{C}[x]\$ is itself computable. Finally, we study computational complexity in finite-dimensional algebras over an algebraically closed field.",
