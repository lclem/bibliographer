  Abstract      = "We give a brief introduction to the clocked lambda calculus, an extension of the classical lambda calculus with a unary symbol tau used to witness the beta-steps. In contrast to the classical lambda calculus, this extension is infinitary strongly normalising and infinitary confluent. The infinitary normal forms are enriched Boehm Trees, which we call clocked Boehm Trees.",
