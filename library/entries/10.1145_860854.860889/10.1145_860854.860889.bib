	Abstract = {We study the link between the complexity of polynomial matrix multiplication and the complexity of solving other basic linear algebra problems on polynomial matrices. By polynomial matrices we mean ntimes n matrices in K[x] of degree bounded by d, with K a commutative field. Under the straight-line program model we show that multiplication is reducible to the problem of computing the coefficient of degree d of the determinant. Conversely, we propose algorithms for minimal approximant computation and column reduction that are based on polynomial matrix multiplication; for the determinant, the straight-line program we give also relies on matrix product over K[x] and provides an alternative to the determinant algorithm of [16, 17]. We further show that all these problems can be solved in particular in O (ω) operations in K. Here the "soft O" notation O indicates some missing log (nd) factors and ω is the exponent of matrix multiplication over K.},
