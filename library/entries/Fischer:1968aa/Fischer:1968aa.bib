	Abstract = {The languages recognizable by time- and space-restricted multiple-counter machines are compared to the languages recognizable by similarly restricted multipletape Turing machines. Special emphasis is placed on languages definable by machines which operate in ``real time''. Time and space requirements for counter machines and Turing machines are analyzed. A number of questions which remain open for time-restricted Turing machines are settled for their counter machine counterparts.},
