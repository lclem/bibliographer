  Abstract      = "We present a new algorithm for the computation of resultants associated with multihomogeneous (and, in particular, homogeneous) polynomial equation systems using straight-line programs. Its complexity is polynomial in the number of coefficients of the input system and the degree of the resultant computed.",
