  Abstract      = {Unambiguous B{\"u}chi automata, i.e. B{\"u}chi automata allowing only one accepting run per word, are a useful restriction of B{\"u}chi automata that is well-suited for probabilistic model-checking. In this paper we propose a more permissive variant, namely finitely ambiguous B{\"u}chi automata, a generalisation where each word has at most k accepting runs, for some fixed k. We adapt existing notions and results concerning finite and bounded ambiguity of finite automata to the setting of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}omega {\$}{\$}-languages and present a translation from arbitrary nondeterministic B{\"u}chi automata with n states to finitely ambiguous automata with at most {\$}{\$}3^n{\$}{\$}states and at most n accepting runs per word.},
