  Abstract      = "In this paper we give an algorithm to determine, for any given suborder closed class of series parallel posets, a structure theorem for the class. We refer to these structure theorems as structural descriptions. This work builds on work of Robertson, Seymour, Thomas, and especially Nigussie on trees. Stated differently, this paper gives an analogue of Nigussie's Tree Algorithm for series parallel posets.",
