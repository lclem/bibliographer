  Abstract      = "Gentzen solved the decision problem for intuitionistic propositional logic in his doctoral thesis [31]; this paper reviews some of the subsequent progress. Solutions to the problem are of importance both for general philosophical reasons and because of their use in implementations of proof assistants (such as Coq [4], widely used in software verification) based on intuitionistic logic.",
