	Abstract = {Timed automata and timed languages [1] constitute a beautiful discovery that opened new perspectives to automata and language theory, as well as new applications to computer-aided verification. However the theory of timed regular languages is far from being achieved. Seven years ago, in [2], I argued that developing such a theory constituted an important research challenge, and I sketched a research program in this direction. Unfortunately, when listing research tasks on timed languages I have overlooked one interesting topic: measuring size of and information content in such languages. Catching up this omission became the focus of my research and the theme of this talk.},
