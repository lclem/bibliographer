  Abstract      = "Safety verification of while programs is often phrased in terms of inclusions {\$}{\$}L(A){\backslash}subseteq L(B){\$}{\$}L(A)⊆L(B)among regular languages. Antichain-based algorithms have been developed as an efficient method to check such inclusions. In this paper, we generalize the idea of antichain-based verification to verifying safety properties of recursive programs. To be precise, we give an antichain-based algorithm for checking inclusions of the form {\$}{\$}L(G){\backslash}subseteq L(B){\$}{\$}L(G)⊆L(B), where {\$}{\$}G{\$}{\$}Gis a context-free grammar and {\$}{\$}B{\$}{\$}Bis a finite automaton. The idea is to phrase the inclusion as a data flow analysis problem over a relational domain. In a second step, we generalize the approach towards bounded context switching.",
