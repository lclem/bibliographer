  Abstract      = "We prove decidability of univariate real algebra extended with predicates for rational and integer powers, i.e., ``{\$}{\$}x^n {\backslash}in {\backslash}mathbb {\{}Q{\}}{\$}{\$}'' and ``{\$}{\$}x^n {\backslash}in {\backslash}mathbb {\{}Z{\}}{\$}{\$}.'' Our decision procedure combines computation over real algebraic cells with the rational root theorem and witness construction via algebraic number density arguments.",
