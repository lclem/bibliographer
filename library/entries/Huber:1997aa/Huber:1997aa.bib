	Abstract = {The stable mixed volume of the Newton polytopes of a polynomial system is defined and shown to equal (genetically) the number of zeros in affine space Cn. This result refines earlier bounds by Rojas, Li, and Wang {$[$}5{$]$}, {$[$}7{$]$}, {$[$}8{$]$}. The homotopies in {$[$}4{$]$}, {$[$}9{$]$}, and {$[$}10{$]$} extend naturally to a computation of all isolated zeros in Cn},
