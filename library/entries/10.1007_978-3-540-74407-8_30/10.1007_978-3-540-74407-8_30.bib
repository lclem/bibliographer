  Abstract      = "We propose a new model for timed games, based on concurrent game structures (CGSs). Compared to the classical timed game automata of Asarin et al. [8], our timed CGSs are ``more concurrent'', in the sense that they always allow all the agents to act on the system, independently of the delay they want to elapse before their action. Timed CGSs weaken the ``element of surprise'' of timed game automata reported by de Alfaro et al. [15].",
