  Abstract      = "Precise complexity results are derived for the model-checking problem for TPTL (timed propositional temporal logic) on (in)finite data words and deterministic one-counter machines. Depending on the number of register variables and the encoding of numbers in constraints (unary or binary), the complexity is either P-complete or PSPACE-complete.",
