	Abstract = {We define a propositionally quantified intuitionistic logic Hπ + by a natural extension of Kripke's semantics for propositional intutionistic logic. We then show that Hπ+ is recursively isomorphic to full second order classical logic. Hπ+ is the intuitionistic analogue of the modal systems S5π +, S4π +, S4.2π +, K4π +, Tπ +, Kπ + and Bπ +, studied by Fine.},
