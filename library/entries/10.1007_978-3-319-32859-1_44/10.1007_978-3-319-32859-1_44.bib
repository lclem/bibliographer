  Abstract      = "This paper concerns the reliable integration of dynamical systems with a focus on the computation of one specific trajectory for a given initial condition at high precision. We describe several algorithmic tricks which allow for faster parallel computations and better error estimates. We also introduce ``Lagrange models''. These serve a similar purpose as the more classical Taylor models, but we will show that they allow for larger step sizes, especially when the truncation orders get large.",
