  Abstract      = "We present a probabilistic Las Vegas algorithm for solving sufficiently generic square polynomial systems over finite fields. We achieve a nearly quadratic running time in the number of solutions, for densely represented input polynomials. We also prove a nearly linear bit complexity bound for polynomial systems with rational coefficients. Our results are obtained using the combination of the Kronecker solver and a new improved algorithm for fast multivariate modular composition.",
