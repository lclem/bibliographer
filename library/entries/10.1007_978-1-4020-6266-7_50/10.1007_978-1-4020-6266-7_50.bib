	Abstract = {This paper deals with the recently re-discovered concept of generalized transfer functions of nonlinear control systems. It especially addresses the problems connected with the computation of the transfer functions, which are elements of a fraction field of non-commutative polynomials. An algorithm for calculation of generalized transfer functions for both continuoustime and discrete-time nonlinear systems based on the modified Gauss-Jordan elimination method is presented and its implementation in Maple computer algebra system is shown.},
