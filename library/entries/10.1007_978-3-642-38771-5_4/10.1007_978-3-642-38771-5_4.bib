	Abstract = {In general, a nondeterministic automaton or machine (for example a finite automaton, pushdown automaton or Turing machine) is called unambiguous if each input is accepted by at most one run or computation. Each deterministic automaton is obviously unambiguous. However, in many settings, unambiguous automata are more expressive or admit more succinct automata than deterministic models, while preserving some good algorithmic properties. The aim of this talk is to survey some classical and some more recent results on unambiguous finite automata over different kind of input structures, namely finite words, infinite words, finite trees, and infinite trees.},
