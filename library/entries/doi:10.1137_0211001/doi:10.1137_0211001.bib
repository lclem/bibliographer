	Abstract = {Let \$\mathbb{C}\$ be the set of all straight-line programs with one input variable, x, using the following instruction set: \$y \leftarrow 0\$, \$y \leftarrow 1\$, \$y \leftarrow y + w\$, \$y \leftarrow y - w\$, \$y \leftarrow y * w\$, and \$y \leftarrow \lfloor y/w \rfloor \$. We show that two programs in \$\mathbb{C}\$ are equivalent over integer inputs if and only if they are equivalent on all inputs x such that \$|x| \leqq 2^{2^{\lambda r^2 } } \$ (\$\lambda \$ is a fixed positive constant and r is the maximum of the lengths of the programs). In contrast, we prove that the zero-equivalence problem (deciding whether a program outputs 0 for all inputs) is undecidable for programs with two input variables. An interesting corollary is the following: Let \$\mathbb{N}\$ be the set of natural numbers and f be any total one-to-one function from \$\mathbb{N}\$ onto \$\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\$ (f is called a pair generator. Such functions are useful in recursive function theory and computability theory.) Then f cannot be computed by any program in \$\mathbb{C}\$.},
