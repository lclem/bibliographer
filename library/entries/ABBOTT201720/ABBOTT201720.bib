  Abstract      = {We present new, practical algorithms for the hypersurface implicitization problem: namely, given a parametric description (in terms of polynomials or rational functions) of the hypersurface, find its implicit equation. Two of them are for polynomial parametrizations: one algorithm, ``ElimTH'', has as main step the computation of an elimination ideal via a truncated, homogeneous Gr{\"o}bner basis. The other algorithm, ``Direct'', computes the implicitization directly using an approach inspired by the generalized Buchberger--M{\"o}ller algorithm. Either may be used inside the third algorithm, ``RatPar'', to deal with parametrizations by rational functions. Finally we show how these algorithms can be used in a modular approach, algorithm ``ModImplicit'', for avoiding the high costs of arithmetic with rational numbers. We exhibit experimental timings to show the practical efficiency of our new algorithms.},
