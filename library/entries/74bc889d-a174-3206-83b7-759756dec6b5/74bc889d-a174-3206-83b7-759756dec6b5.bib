  Abstract      = "Fix pairwise coprime positive integers $p\_1 ,p\_2 ,....,p\_s $ . We propose representing integers u modulo m, where m is any positive integer up to roughly $\sqrt {p\_1 ,p\_2 ,....,p\_s } $ , as vectors $(u\bmod p\_1 ,u\bmod p\_2 ,....,u\bmod p\_s )$ . We use this representation to obtain a new result on the parallel complexity of modular exponentiation: there is an algorithm for the Common CRCW PRAM that, given positive integers x, e, and m in binary, of total bit length n, computes $x^e $ mod m in time $O(n/\lg \lg n)$ using $n^{O(1)} $ processors. For comparison, a parallelization of the standard binary algorithm takes superlinear time; Adleman and Kompella gave an $O((\lg n)^3 )$ expected time algorithm using $O((\lg n)^3 )$ processors; von zur Gathen gave an NC algorithm for the highly special case that m is polynomially smooth.",
