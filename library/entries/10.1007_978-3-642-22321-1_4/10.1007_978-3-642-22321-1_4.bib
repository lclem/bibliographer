	Abstract = {Regular expressions [4] and tools to handle them, especially tools for regular expression matching---an early one is described in the seminal paper [5] by Ken Thompson---, are one of the major achievements of formal language and automata theory. Google counts 303,000 results for ``regular expressions matching'' (May 4, 2011); there are numerous command line tools for working with regular expressions such as grep; Google released a regular expression C++ library not long ago [3]; almost every programming language provides support for regular expressions; and even the text editor I am using to produce the source code of this LaTeX document has an extensive regular expression library.},
