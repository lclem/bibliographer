  Abstract      = "Abstract The inclusion of Regular Expressions (REs) is the kernel of any type-checking algorithm for \{XML\} manipulation languages. \{XML\} applications would benefit from the extension of \{REs\} with interleaving and counting, but this is not feasible in general, since inclusion is EXPSPACE-complete for such extended REs. In Colazzo et al. (2009) [1] we introduced a notion of ``conflict-free REs'', which are extended \{REs\} with excellent complexity behaviour, including a polynomial inclusion algorithm [1] and linear membership (Ghelli et al., 2008 [2]). Conflict-free \{REs\} have interleaving and counting, but the complexity is tamed by the ``conflict-free'' limitations, which have been found to be satisfied by the vast majority of the content models published on the Web. However, a type-checking algorithm needs to compare machine-generated subtypes against human-defined supertypes. The conflict-free restriction, while quite harmless for the human-defined supertype, is far too restrictive for the subtype. We show here that the \{PTIME\} inclusion algorithm can be actually extended to deal with totally unrestricted \{REs\} with counting and interleaving in the subtype position, provided that the supertype is conflict-free. This is exactly the expressive power that we need in order to use subtyping inside type-checking algorithms, and the cost of this generalized algorithm is only quadratic, which is as good as the best algorithm we have for the symmetric case (see [1]). The result is extremely surprising, since we had previously found that symmetric inclusion becomes NP-hard as soon as the candidate subtype is enriched with binary intersection, a generalization that looked much more innocent than what we achieve here.",
