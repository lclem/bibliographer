  Abstract      = "In this work we tackle the following problem: given a timed automaton, restrict its transition relation in a systematic way so that all the remaining behaviors satisfy certain properties. This is an extension of the problem of controller synthesis for discrete event dynamical systems, where in addition to choosing among actions, the controller have the option of doing nothing and let the time pass. The problem is formulated using the notion of a real-time game, and a winning strategy is constructed as a fixed-point of an operator on the space of states and clock configurations.",
