	Abstract = {A formal power series âˆ‘ f(n)xn is said to be differentiably finite if it satisfies a linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients. Such power series arise in a wide variety of problems in enumerative combinatorics. The basic properties of such series of significance to combinatorics are surveyed. Some reciprocity theorems are proved which link two such series together. A number of examples, applications and open problems are discussed.},
