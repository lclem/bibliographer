  Abstract      = "The Krohn-Rhodes theorem states that any deterministic automaton is a homomorphic image of a cascade of very simple automata which realize either resets or permutations. Moreover, if the automaton is counter-free, only reset automata are needed. In this paper we give a very constructive proof of a variant of this theorem due to Eilenberg.",
