  Abstract      = "A deterministic pushdown acceptor is called a simple machine when it is restricted to have only one state, operate in real-time, and accept by empty store. While the existence of an effective procedure for deciding equivalence of languages accepted by these simple machines is well-known, it is shown that this family is powerful enough to have an undecidable inclusion problem. It follows that the inclusion problems for the LL(k) languages and the free monadic recursion schemes that do not use an identity function are also undecidable.",
