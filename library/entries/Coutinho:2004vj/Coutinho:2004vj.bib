  Abstract      = "A keystone of the theory of noncommutative noetherian rings is the theorem that establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for a given ring to have a quotient ring. We trace the development of this theorem, and its applications, from its first version for noncommutative domains in the 1930s to Goldie's theorems in the late 1950s.",
