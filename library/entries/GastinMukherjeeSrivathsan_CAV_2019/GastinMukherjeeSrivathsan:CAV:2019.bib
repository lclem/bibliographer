  Abstract      = {A popular method for solving reachability in timed automata proceeds by enumerating reachable sets of valuations represented as zones. A na{\"\i}ve enumeration of zones does not terminate. Various termination mechanisms have been studied over the years. Coming up with efficient termination mechanisms has been remarkably more challenging when the automaton has diagonal constraints in guards.},
