  Abstract      = "We present two active learning algorithms for sound deterministic negotiations. Sound deterministic negotiations are models of distributed systems, a kind of Petri nets or Zielonka automata with additional structure. We show that this additional structure allows to minimize such negotiations. The two active learning algorithms differ in the type of membership queries they use. Both have similar complexity to Angluin's L* algorithm, in particular, the number of queries is polynomial in the size of the negotiation, and not in the number of configurations.",
