  Abstract      = "We consider systems with unboundedly many processes that communicate through shared memory. In that context, simple verification questions have a high complexity or, in the case of pushdown processes, are even undecidable. Good algorithmic properties are recovered under round-bounded verification, which restricts the system behavior to a bounded number of round-robin schedules. In this paper, we extend this approach to a game-based setting. This allows one to solve synthesis and control problems and constitutes a further step towards a theory of languages over infinite alphabets.",
