	Abstract = {In this paper we investigate a case of the reachability problem in controlled o-minimal dynamical systems. This problem can be formulated as follows. Given a controlled o-minimal dynamical system initial and target sets, find a finite choice of time points and control parameters applied at these points such that the target set is reachable from the initial set. We prove that the existence of a finite control strategy is decidable and construct a polynomial complexity algorithm which generates finite control strategies for one-dimensional controlled polynomial dynamical systems. For this algorithm we also show an upper bound on the numbers of switches in finite control strategies.},
