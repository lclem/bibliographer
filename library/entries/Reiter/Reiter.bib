  Abstract      = "Inspired by distributed algorithms, we introduce a new class of finite graph automata that recognize precisely the graph languages definable in monadic second-order logic. For the cases of words and trees, it has been long known that the regular languages are precisely those definable in monadic second-order logic. In this regard, the automata proposed in the present work can be seen, to some extent, as a generalization of finite automata to graphs.",
