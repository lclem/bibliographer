	Abstract = {The aim of the paper is to apply the polynomial methods to nonlinear realization problem. A new formula is presented which allows to compute the differentials of the state coordinates directly from the polynomial description of the nonlinear system, yielding a shorter and more compact program code in Mathematica implementation.},
