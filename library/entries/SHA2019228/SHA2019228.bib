  Abstract      = "In this paper, given a simple linear recurrence sequence of algebraic numbers, which has either a dominant characteristic root or exactly two characteristic roots of maximal modulus, we give some explicit lower bounds for the index beyond which every term of the sequence is non-zero. It turns out that this case covers almost all such sequences whose coefficients are rational numbers.",
