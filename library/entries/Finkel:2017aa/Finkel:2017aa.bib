  Abstract      = "A system of communicating finite state machines is synchronizable if its send trace semantics, i.e. the set of sequences of sendings it can perform, is the same when its communications are FIFO asynchronous and when they are just rendezvous synchronizations. This property was claimed to be decidable in several conference and journal papers. In this paper, we show that synchronizability is actually undecidable. We show that synchronizability is decidable if the topology of communications is an oriented ring. We also show that, in this case, synchronizability implies the absence of unspecified receptions and orphan messages, and the channel-recognizability of the reachability set.",
