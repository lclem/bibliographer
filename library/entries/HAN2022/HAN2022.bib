  Abstract      = "The degree of ambiguity (respectively, the path size) of a nondeterministic automaton, on a given input, measures the number of accepting computations (respectively, the number of all computations). It is known that deciding the finiteness of the degree of ambiguity of a nondeterministic pushdown automaton is undecidable. Also, it is undecidable for a given kâ‰¥3 to decide whether the path size of a nondeterministic pushdown automaton is bounded by k. As the main result, we show that deciding the finiteness of the path size of a nondeterministic pushdown automaton can be done in polynomial time. Also, we show that the k-path problem for nondeterministic input-driven pushdown automata (respectively, for nondeterministic finite automata) is complete for exponential time (respectively, complete for polynomial space).",
