  Abstract      = "Using the program transformation technique we derive some algorithms for evaluating linear recurrence relations in logarithmic time. The particular case of the Fibonacci function is first considered and a comparison with the conventional matrix exponentiation algorithm is made. This comparison allows us also to contrast the transformation technique and the stepwise refinement technique underlining some interesting features of the former one. Through the examples given we also explain why those features are interesting for a useful and reliable program construction methodology.",
