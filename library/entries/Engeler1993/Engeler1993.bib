	Abstract = {The axiomatization presented in the previous section is an attempt to axiomatize the set of theorems true in the intended structure. How well does it do this? The best for which one can hope in an axiomatization is that it can serve as the basis for an effective decision procedure, i.e. a procedure which, given any sentence S of the language, decides in finitely many steps whether or not S is true in the intended structure. The most informative decision procedures are those which proceed by quantifier elimination. This method is also the oldest. It was applied in the twenties by Langford to the theory of dense orderings, by Presburger to the (additive) theory of the integers, and finally by Tarski to the theory that we are considering. The paper by Yu. Ershov, mentioned in the references, surveys numerous subsequent applications of the method.},
