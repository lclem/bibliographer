  Abstract      = "The goal in this paper is to find closed form solutions for linear recurrence equations, by transforming an input equation L to an equation Ls with known solutions. The main problem is how to find a solved equation Ls to which L can be reduced. We solve this problem by computing local data at singularities, data that remains invariant under the transformations used.",
