    abstract = {The set of 123-avoiding permutations (alias words in {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}{\{}1, {$\backslash$}ldots, n{$\backslash$}{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}with exactly 1 occurrence of each letter) is famously enumerated by the ubiquitous Catalan numbers, whose generating function C(x) famously satisfies the algebraic equation {\$}{\$}{\{}C(x) = 1 + xC(x)\^{}{\{}2{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}. Recently, Bill Chen, Alvin Dai, and Robin Zhou found (and very elegantly proved) an algebraic equation satisfied by the generating function enumerating 123-avoiding words with two occurrences of each of {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}{\{}1, {$\backslash$}ldots, n{$\backslash$}{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}. Inspired by the Chen-Dai-Zhou result, we present an algorithm for finding such an algebraic equation for the ordinary generating function enumerating 123- avoiding words with exactly r occurrences of each of {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}{\{}1, {$\backslash$}ldots, n{$\backslash$}{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}for any positive integer r, thereby proving that they are algebraic, and not merely D-finite (a fact that is promised by WZ theory). Our algorithm consists of presenting an algebraic enumeration scheme, combined with the Buchberger algorithm.},
