  Abstract      = "{Alternating vector addition systems are obtained by equipping vector addition systems with states (VASS) with 'fork' rules, and provide a natural setting for infinite-arena games played over a VASS. Initially introduced in the study of propositional linear logic, they have more recently gathered attention in the guise of multi-dimensional energy games for quantitative verification and synthesis. We show that establishing who is the winner in such a game with a state reachability objective is 2-ExpTime-complete. As a further application, we show that the same complexity result applies to the problem of whether a VASS is simulated by a finite-state system.}",
