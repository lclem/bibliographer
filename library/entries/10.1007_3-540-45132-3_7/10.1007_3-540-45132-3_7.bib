	Abstract = {The equivalence problem for deterministic pushdown automata has been shown decidable in [S{\'e}n97c,{\'e}n97a,S{\'e}n97b,{\'e}n01,Sti99]. We give some applications of this decidability result to other problems arising in the following areas of theoretical computer science:programming languages theoryinfinite graph theoryThue-systems},
