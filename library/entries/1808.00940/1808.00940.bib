  Abstract      = "Let $n$ be a natural number and $\mathcal{M}$ a set of $n \times n$-matrices over the nonnegative integers such that the joint spectral radius of $\mathcal{M}$ is at most one. We show that if the zero matrix $0$ is a product of matrices in $\mathcal{M}$, then there are $M\_1, \ldots, M\_{n^5} \in \mathcal{M}$ with $M\_1 \cdots M\_{n^5} = 0$. This result has applications in automata theory and the theory of codes. Specifically, if $X \subset \Sigma^*$ is a finite incomplete code, then there exists a word $w \in \Sigma^*$ of length polynomial in $\sum\_{x \in X} |x|$ such that $w$ is not a factor of any word in $X^*$. This proves a weak version of Restivo's conjecture.",
  comments      = "This version has been accepted by the SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics (SIDMA). The article extends the STACS'19 paper as follows. (1) The main result has been generalized to monoids generated by finite sets whose joint spectral radius is at most 1. (2) The use of Carpi's theorem is avoided. (3) A more precise result is offered on Restivo's conjecture for finite codes",
