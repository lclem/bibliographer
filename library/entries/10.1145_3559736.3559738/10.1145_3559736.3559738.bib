  Abstract      = "Given a timed automaton A and a control state q, does there exist a run of A that visits q? This problem of control state reachability in timed automata was posed in [Alur and Dill 1994] and is known to be PSPACE-complete. One does not hope to have efficient algorithms for this problem, in theory. Nevertheless, research in this subject over the last three decades has led to industry-strength award-winning tools implementing this problem. This topic continues to be an active area of research even now. In this article, we present one successful algorithmic framework for attacking this problem.",
