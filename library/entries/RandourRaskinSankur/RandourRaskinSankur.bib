  Abstract      = "Multi-dimensional weighted Markov decision processes (MDPs) are useful to analyze systems with multiple objectives that are potentially conflicting and make necessary the analysis of trade-offs. In this paper, we study the complexity of percentile queries in such MDPs and provide algorithms to synthesize strategies that enforce such constraints. Given a multi-dimensional weighted MDP and a quantitative payoff function $f$, quantitative thresholds $v\_i$ (one per dimension), and probability thresholds $\alpha\_i$, we show how to compute a single strategy that enforces that for all dimension $i$, the probability that an outcome $\rho$ satisfies $f\_i(\rho) \geq v\_i$ is at least $\alpha\_i$. We study this problem for the classical quantitative payoffs studied in the literature (sup, inf, lim sup, lim inf, mean-payoff, truncated sum, discounted sum). So our work can be seen as an extension to the quantitative case of the multi-objective model checking problem on MDPs studied by Etessami et al. in unweighted MDPs.",
