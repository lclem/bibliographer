  Abstract      = {Unambiguous automata, i.e., nondeterministic automata with the restriction of having at most one accepting run over a word, have the potential to be used instead of deterministic automata in settings where nondeterministic automata can not be applied in general. In this paper, we provide a polynomially time-bounded algorithm for probabilistic model checking of discrete-time Markov chains against unambiguous B\"uchi automata specifications and report on our implementation and experiments.},
