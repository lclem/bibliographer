  Abstract      = "Higher-order recursion schemes (HORS) have received much attention as a useful abstraction of higher-order functional programs with a number of new verification techniques employing HORS model-checking as their centrepiece. We give an account of the C-SHORe tool, which contributed to the ongoing quest for a truly scalable model-checker for HORS by offering a different, automata theoretic perspective. C-SHORe implements the first practical model-checking algorithm that acts on a generalisation of pushdown automata equi-expressive with HORS called collapsible pushdown systems (CPDS). At its core is a backwards saturation algorithm for CPDS. Additionally, it is able to use information gathered from an approximate forward reachability analysis to guide its backward search. Moreover, it uses an algorithm that prunes the CPDS prior to model-checking and a method for extracting counter-examples in negative instances. We provide an up-to-date comparison of C-SHORe with the state-of-the-art verification tools for HORS. The tool and additional material are available from",
