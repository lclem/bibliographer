  Abstract      = "Several classical combinatorial quantities---including factorials, Bell numbers, tangent numbers{\ldots}---have been shown to form eventually periodic sequences modulo any integer. We relate this phenomenon to the existence of continued fraction expansions for corresponding ordinary (and divergent) generating functions. This leads to a class of congruences obtained in a uniform way.",
