	Abstract = {We introduce a cut-free sequent calculus for the alternation-free fragment of the modal {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mu {\$}{\$}$\mu$-calculus. This system allows both for infinite and for finite, circular proofs and uses a simple focus mechanism to control the unravelling of fixpoints along infinite branches. We show that the proof system is sound and complete for the set of guarded valid formulas of the alternation-free {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mu {\$}{\$}$\mu$-calculus.},
