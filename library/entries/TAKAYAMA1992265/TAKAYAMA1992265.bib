  Abstract      = "The class of ``holonomic function'' is considered. We present a quasi-algorithm that recognizes whether a holonomic function is zero or not. The algorithm consists of procedures which obtain differential operators that annihilate sums, products, and definite integrals with, respect to parameters of holonomic functions. A Weyl algebra-analog of Buchberger's algorithm is used. A ``holonomic'' approach to the zero recognition algorithm was initiated by D. Zeilberger (1990) who realized it by Sylvester's dyalitic elimination. Our algorithm uses Buchberger's algorithm to improve Zeilberger's algorithm.",
