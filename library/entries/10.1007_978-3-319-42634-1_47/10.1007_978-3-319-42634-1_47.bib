  Abstract      = "In the last two decades visibly pushdown languages (VPLs) have found many applications in diverse areas such as formal verification and processing of XML documents. Recently, there has been a significant interest in studying quantitative versions of finite-state systems as well as visibly pushdown systems. In this work, we take forward this study for visibly pushdown systems by considering a functional version of visibly pushdown automata. Our version is formally a generalization of cost register automata (CRA) defined by [Alur et al., 2013]. We observe that our model continues to have all the good properties of the CRAs in spite of being a generalization.",
