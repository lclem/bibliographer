  Abstract      = "Two structures are observed close to the kinematic threshold in the $\Xi\_b^0 \pi^-$ mass spectrum in a sample of proton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb$^{-1}$ recorded by the LHCb experiment. In the quark model, two baryonic resonances with quark content $bds$ are expected in this mass region: the spin-parity $J^P = \frac{1}{2}^+$ and $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^+$ states, denoted $\Xi\_b^{\prime -}$ and $\Xi\_b^{*-}$. Interpreting the structures as these resonances, we measure the mass differences and the width of the heavier state to be",
