  Abstract      = "System requirements related to concepts like information flow, knowledge, and robustness cannot be judged in terms of individual system executions, but rather require an analysis of the relationship between multiple executions. Such requirements belong to the class of hyperproperties, which generalize classic trace properties to properties of sets of traces. During the past decade, a range of new specification logics has been introduced with the goal of providing a unified theory for reasoning about hyperproperties. This paper gives an overview on the current landscape of logics for the specification of hyperproperties and on algorithms for satisfiability checking, model checking, monitoring, and synthesis.",
