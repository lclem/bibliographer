  Abstract      = "We give a complete self-contained proof of Statman's finite completeness theoremand of a corollary of this theorem stating that the -definability conjectureimplies the higher-order matching conjecture.Keywords: simply typed lambda-calculus, finite model, lambda-definability,higher-order matchingThe purpose of this note is to give a complete self-contained proof ofStatman's finite completeness theorem and of a corollary of this theoremstating that the -definability conjecture implies the higher-order matchingconjecture. Both results are proved in {$[$}8{$]$} (theorem 2 and 5). Although, since{$[$}8{$]$} assumes some familiarity with typed -calculus model theory and presentsseveral results in short space, it may be not very accessible to readers notfamiliar with this subject.Section 1 gives the basic notations used in the paper. The reader notfamiliar with simply typed -calculus should consult Hindley and Seldin {$[$}3{$]$}.Section 2 presents standard models for simply typed -calculus, it is...",
