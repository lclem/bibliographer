  Abstract      = "We study the arithmetic complexity of iterated matrix multiplication. We show that any multilinear homogeneous depth-4 arithmetic formula computing the product of \$d\$ generic matrices of size \$n \times n\$, \$\mathrm{IMM}\\_{n,d}\$, has size \$n^{\Omega(\sqrt{d})}\$ as long as \$d = n^{O(1)}\$. This improves the result of Nisan and Wigderson [Comput. Complexity, 6 (1997), pp. 217--234] for depth-4 set-multilinear formulas. We also study \$\Sigma\Pi^{[O(d/t)]}\Sigma\Pi^{[t]}\$ formulas, which are depth-4 formulas with the stated bounds on the fan-ins of the \$\Pi\$ gates. A recent depth reduction result of Tavenas [Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci. 8087, 2013, pp. 813--824] shows that any \$n\$-variate degree \$d = n^{O(1)}\$ polynomial computable by a circuit of size \$\mathop{\mathrm{poly}}(n)\$ can also be computed by a depth-4 \$\Sigma\Pi^{[O(d/t)]}\Sigma\Pi^{[t]}\$ formula of top fan-in \$n^{O(d/t)}\$. We show that any such formula computing \$\mathrm{IMM}\\_{n,d}\$ has top fan-in \$n^{\Omega({d/t})}\$, proving the optimality of Tavenas' result. This also strengthens a result of Kayal, Saha, and Saptharishi [Proceedings of STOC, 2014, pp. 146--153], which gives a similar lower bound for an explicit polynomial in VNP.",
