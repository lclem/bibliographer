  Abstract      = "We consider the following problem: given d \texttimes{} d rational matrices A1, {\ldots}, Ak and a polyhedral cone , decide whether there exists a non-zero vector whose orbit under multiplication by A1, {\ldots}, Ak is contained in . This problem can be interpreted as verifying the termination of multi-path while loops with linear updates and linear guard conditions. We show that this problem is decidable for commuting invertible matrices A1, {\ldots}, Ak. The key to our decision procedure is to reinterpret this problem in a purely algebraic manner. Namely, we discover its connection with modules over the polynomial ring as well as the polynomial semiring . The loop termination problem is then reduced to deciding whether a submodule of contains a ``positive'' element.",
