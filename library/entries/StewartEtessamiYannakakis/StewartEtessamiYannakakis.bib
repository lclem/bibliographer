  Abstract      = "A central computational problem for analyzing and model checking various classes of infinite-state recursive probabilistic systems (including quasi-birth-death processes, multi-type branching processes, stochastic context-free grammars, probabilistic pushdown automata and recursive Markov chains) is the computation of {\em termination probabilities}, and computing these probabilities in turn boils down to computing the {\em least fixed point} (LFP) solution of a corresponding {\em monotone polynomial system} (MPS) of equations, denoted x=P(x).",
