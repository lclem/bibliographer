  Abstract      = "Assuming a widely believed hypothesis concerning the least prime in an arithmetic progression, we show that polynomials of degree less than\&nbsp; ( n ) over a finite field ( mathbb {F}\_q ) with\&nbsp; ( q ) elements can be multiplied in time ( O (n log q log (n log q)) ) , uniformly in ( q ) . Under the same hypothesis, we show how to multiply two ( n ) -bit integers in time ( O (n log n) ) ; this algorithm is somewhat simpler than the unconditional algorithm from the companion paper\&nbsp;[22]. Our results hold in the Turing machine model with a finite number\&nbsp;of\&nbsp;tapes.",
