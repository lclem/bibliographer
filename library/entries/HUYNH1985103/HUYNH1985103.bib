  Abstract      = "In this paper we investigate the computational complexity of the inequivalence problems for commutative grammars. We show that the inequivalence problems for type 0 and context-sensitive commutative grammars are undecidable whereas decidability in nondeterministic exponential-time holds for the classes of regular and context-free commutative grammars. For the latter the inequivalence problems are Î£p2-hard.",
