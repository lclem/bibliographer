	Abstract = {In this note, a new method for taking the first few terms of a sequence and making an educated guess as to the generating function of the sequence is described. The method involves a matrix factorization into lower triangular, diagonal, and upper triangular matrices (the LDU decomposition), generating functions, and solving a first-order differential equation.},
