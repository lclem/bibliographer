  Abstract      = {{We introduce parameterized communicating automata (PCA) as a model of systems where finite-state processes communicate through FIFO channels. Unlike classical communicating automata, a given PCA can be run on any network topology of bounded degree. The topology is thus a parameter of the system. We provide various B{\"u}chi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot theorems for PCA, which roughly read as follows: Given a logical specification \phi and a class of topologies T, there is a PCA that is equivalent to \phi on all topologies from T. We give uniform constructions which allow us to instantiate T with concrete classes such as pipelines, ranked trees, grids, rings, etc. The proofs build on a locality theorem for first-order logic due to Schwentick and Barthelmann, and they exploit concepts from the non-parameterized case, notably a result by Genest, Kuske, and Muscholl.}},
