	Abstract = {We describe a new approach to synthesizing a timed automaton from a set of timed scenarios. The set of scenarios specifies a set of behaviours, i.e., sequences of events that satisfy the time constraints imposed by the scenarios. The language of the constructed automaton is equivalent to that set of behaviours. Every location of the automaton appears in at least one accepting run, and its graph is constructed so as to minimise the number of clocks. The construction allows a new clock allocation algorithm whose cost is linear in the number of edges.},
