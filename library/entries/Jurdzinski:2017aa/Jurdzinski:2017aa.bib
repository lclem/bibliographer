  Abstract      = "Calude et al. have given the first algorithm for solving parity games in quasi-polynomial time, where previously the best algorithms were mildly subexponential. We combine the succinct counting technique of Calude et al.\ with the small progress measure technique of Jurdzi\'nski. Our contribution is two-fold: we provide an alternative exposition of the ideas behind the groundbreaking quasi-polynomial algorithm of Calude et al., and we use it to reduce the space required from quasi-polynomial to nearly linear.",
