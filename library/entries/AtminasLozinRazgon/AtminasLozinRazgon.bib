  Abstract      = "Recently, Daligault, Rao and Thomass\'e asked in [3] if every hereditary class which is well-quasi-ordered by the induced subgraph relation is of bounded clique-width. There are two reasons why this questions is interesting. First, it connects two seemingly unrelated notions. Second, if the question is answered affirmatively, this will have a strong algorithmic consequence. In particular, this will mean (through the use of Courcelle theorem [2]), that any problem definable in Monadic Second Order Logic can be solved in a polynomial time on any class well-quasi-ordered by the induced subgraph relation. In the present paper, we answer this question affirmatively for graphs without large bicliques. Thus the above algorithmic consequence is true, for example, for classes of graphs of bounded degree.",
