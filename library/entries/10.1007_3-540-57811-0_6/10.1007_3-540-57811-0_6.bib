	Abstract = {We consider the problem of identifying the behavior of an unknown automaton with multiplicity in the field Q of rational numbers (Q-automaton) from multiplicity and equivalence queries. We provide an algorithm which is polynomial in the size of the Q-automaton and of the maximum length of the given counterexamples. As a consequence, we have that Q-automata are PAC-learnable in polynomial time when multiplicity queries are allowed. A corollary of this result is that regular languages are polynomially predictable using membership queries w.r.t. the representation of unambiguous non-deterministic automata. This is important, as there are unambiguous automata such that the equivalent deterministic automaton has an exponentially larger number of states.},
