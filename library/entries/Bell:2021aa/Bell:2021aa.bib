	Abstract = {A (noncommutative) P{\'o}lya series over a field K is a formal power series whose nonzero coefficients are contained in a finitely generated subgroup of {\$}{\$}K\^{}{$\backslash$}times {\$}{\$}. We show that rational P{\'o}lya series are unambiguous rational series, proving a 40 year old conjecture of Reutenauer. The proof combines methods from noncommutative algebra, automata theory, and number theory (specifically, unit equations). As a corollary, a rational series is a P{\'o}lya series if and only if it is Hadamard sub-invertible. Phrased differently, we show that every weighted finite automaton taking values in a finitely generated subgroup of a field (and zero) is equivalent to an unambiguous weighted finite automaton.},
