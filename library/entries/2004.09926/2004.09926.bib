  Abstract      = {We study the matching problem "$\exists\sigma:\sigma(L)\subseteq R$?" where $L,R$ are regular tree languages over finite ranked alphabets $X$ and $\Sigma$ respectively, and $\sigma$ is a substitution such that $\sigma(x)$ is a set of trees in $T(\Sigma\cup H)\setminus H$ for all $x\in X$. Here, $H$ denotes a set of holes which are used to define a concatenation of trees. Conway studied this problem in the special case for languages of finite words in his classical textbook "Regular algebra and finite machines" and showed that if $L$ and $R$ are regular, then the problem "$\exists \sigma:\forall x\in X:\sigma(x)\neq\emptyset\wedge\sigma(L)\subseteq R$?" is decidable. Moreover, there are only finitely many maximal solutions, which are regular and effectively computable. We extend Conway's results when $L,R$ are regular languages of finite and infinite trees, and language substitution is applied inside-out. We show that if $L\subseteq T(X)$ and $R\subseteq T(\Sigma)$ are regular tree languages then the problem "$\exists\sigma\forall x\in X:\sigma(x)\neq\emptyset\wedge\sigma\_{io}(L)\subseteq R$?" is decidable. Moreover, there are only finitely many maximal solutions, which are regular and effectively computable. The corresponding question for the outside-in extension $\sigma\_{oi}$ remains open, even in the restricted setting of finite trees. Our main result is the decidability of "$\exists\sigma:\sigma\_{io}(L)\subseteq R$?" if $R$ is regular and $L$ belongs to a class of tree languages closed under intersection with regular sets. Such a special case pops up if $L$ is context-free.},
  comments      = "35 pages. We corrected several typos and misprints. We also added a few results. The problem whether our main results (Theorem 30 and Corollary 32) also holds for the outside-in extension $\sigma\_{oi}$ (in the sense of Engelfriet and Schmidt 1977 and 1978) remains open",
