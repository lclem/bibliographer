	Abstract = {A nondeterministic automaton is finitely ambiguous if for each input there is at most finitely many accepting runs. We prove that the complement of the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}omega {\$}{\$}-language accepted by a finitely ambiguous B{\"u}chi automaton with n states is accepted by an unambiguous B{\"u}chi automaton with {\$}{\$}2{\backslash}times 5^n{\$}{\$}states.},
