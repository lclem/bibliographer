	Abstract = {We present a new algorithm to construct a (generalized) deterministic Rabin automaton for an LTL formula {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}varphi {\$}{\$}. The automaton is the product of a co-B{\"u}chi automaton for {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}varphi {\$}{\$}and an array of Rabin automata, one for each {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathbf {\{}G{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}-subformula of {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}varphi {\$}{\$}. The Rabin automaton for {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathbf {\{}G{\}}{\}}{$\backslash$}psi {\$}{\$}is in charge of recognizing whether {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathbf {\{}F{\}}{\}}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathbf {\{}G{\}}{\}}{$\backslash$}psi {\$}{\$}holds. This information is passed to the co-B{\"u}chi automaton that decides on acceptance. As opposed to standard procedures based on Safra's determinization, the states of all our automata have a clear logical structure, which allows for various optimizations. Experimental results show improvement in the sizes of the resulting automata compared to existing methods.},
