	Abstract = {Register automata are one of the most studied automata models over infinite alphabets with applications in learning, systems modelling and program verification. We present an equivalence checker for deterministic register automata, called DEQ, based on a recent polynomial-time algorithm that employs group-theoretic techniques to achieve succinct representations of the search space. We compare the performance of our tool to other available implementations, notably in the learning library RALib and nominal frameworks LOIS and NLambda.},
