  Abstract      = "We present improved uniform TC0 circuits for division, matrix powering, and related problems, where the improvement is in terms of ``majority depth'' (as studied by Maciel and Th{\'e}rien). As a corollary, we obtain improved bounds on the complexity of certain problems involving arithmetic circuits, which are known to lie in the counting hierarchy.",
