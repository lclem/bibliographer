  Abstract      = "{We study a model for recursive functional programs called, higher order recursion schemes (HORS). We give new proofs of two verification related problems: reflection and selection for HORS. The previous proofs are based on the equivalence between HORS and collapsible push- down automata and they looses the structure of the initial program. The constructions presen- ted here are based on shape preserving transformations, and can be applied on actual programs without losing the structure of the program.}",
