  Abstract      = "For any $m \geq 1$, let $H\_m$ denote the quantity $H\_m := \liminf\_{n \to \infty} (p\_{n+m}-p\_n)$, where $p\_n$ denotes the $n^{\operatorname{th}}$ prime; thus for instance the twin prime conjecture is equivalent to the assertion that $H\_1$ is equal to two. In a recent breakthrough paper of Zhang, a finite upper bound was obtained for the first time on $H\_1$; more specifically, Zhang showed that $H\_1 \leq 70000000$.",
