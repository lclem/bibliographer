  Abstract      = "A Craig interpolant [1] for a mutually inconsistent pair of formulas (A,B) is a formula that is (1) implied by A, (2) inconsistent with B, and (3) expressed over the common variables of A and B. It is known that a Craig interpolant can be efficiently derived from a refutation of A âˆ§ B, for certain theories and proof systems. For example, interpolants can be derived from resolution proofs in propositional logic, and for ``cutting planes'' proofs for systems of linear inequalities over the reals [5,3]. These methods have been extended to the theory of linear inequalities with uninterpreted function symbols [4].",
