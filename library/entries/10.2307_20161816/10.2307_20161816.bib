  Abstract      = {Let A be a commutative Noetherian ring, and let R = A[X] be the polynomial ring in an infinite collection X of indeterminates over A. Let $\germ{S}\_{X}$ be the group of permutations of X. The group $\germ{S}\_{X}$ acts on R in a natural way, and this in turn gives R the structure of a left module over the group ring $R[\germ{S}\_{X}]$ . We prove that all ideals of R invariant under the action of $\germ{S}\_{X}$ are finitely generated as $R[\germ{S}\_{X}]$ -modules. The proof involves introducing a certain well-quasi-ordering on monomials and developing a theory of Gr{\"o}bner bases and reduction in this setting. We also consider the concept of an invariant chain of ideals for finite-dimensional polynomial rings and relate it to the finite generation result mentioned above. Finally, a motivating question from chemistry is presented, with the above framework providing a suitable context in which to study it.},
