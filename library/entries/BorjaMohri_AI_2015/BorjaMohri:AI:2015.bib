  Abstract      = "Weighted finite automata (WFA) are finite automata whose transitions and states are augmented with some weights, elements of a semiring. A WFA induces a function over strings. The value it assigns to an input string is the semiring sum of the weights of all paths labeled with that string, where the weight of a path is obtained by taking the semiring product of the weights of its constituent transitions, as well as those of its origin and destination states.",
