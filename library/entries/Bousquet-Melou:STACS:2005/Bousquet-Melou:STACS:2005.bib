  Abstract      = "Numerous families of simple discrete objects (words, trees, lattice walks...) are counted by a rational or algebraic generating function. Whereas it seems that objects with a rational generating function have a structure very similar to the structure of words of a regular language, objects with an algebraic generating function remain more mysterious. Some of them, of course, exhibit a clear ``algebraic'' structure, which recalls the structure of words of context-free languages. For many other objects, such a structure has not yet been discovered. We list several examples of this type, and discuss various methods for proving the algebraicity of a generating function.",
