  Abstract      = "A sequence of graphs Gnis iteratively constructible if it can be built from an initial labeled graph by means of a repeated fixed succession of elementary operations involving addition of vertices and edges, deletion of edges, and relabelings. Let Gnbe a iteratively constructible sequence of graphs. In a recent paper, [27], M. Noy and A. Rib{\`o} have proven linear recurrences with polynomial coefficients for the Tutte polynomials T(Gi, x,y){\thinspace}={\thinspace}T(Gi), i.e.",
