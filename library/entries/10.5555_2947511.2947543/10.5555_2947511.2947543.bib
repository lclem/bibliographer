  Abstract      = "To give an efficiently computable representation of the zeros of a zero-dimensional ideal I, Rouillier (1996) introduced the rational univariate representation (RUR) as an extension of the generalized shape lemma (GSL) proposed by Alonso et al. (1996). In this paper, we propose a new method to compute the RUR of the radical of I, and report on its practical implementation. In the new method, the RUR of the radical of I is computed efficiently by applying modular techniques to solving the systems of linear equations. The performance of the method is examined by practical experiments. We also discuss its theoretical efficiency.",
