	Abstract = {An algorithm is designed which tests solvability of a system of k polynomial equations in n variables with degrees d within complexity polynomial in {\$}n^{\{}d^{\{}3k{\}}{\}}{\$}. If the system is solvable then the algorithm yields one of its solutions. Thus, for fixed d, k the complexity of the algorithm is polynomial.},
