	Abstract = {LetI be an ideal in a polynomial ring over a perfect field. We given new methods for computing the equidimensional parts and radical ofI, for localizingI with respect to another ideal, and thus for finding the primary decomposition ofI. Our methods rest on modern ideas from commutative algebra, and are direct in the sense that they avoid the generic projections used by Hermann (1926) and all others until now.},
