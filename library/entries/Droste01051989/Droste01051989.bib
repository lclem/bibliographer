  Abstract      = "This paper and its predecessor examine certain infinite semilinear orders (`trees') and their automorphism groups. Here we classify weakly 2-transitive trees up to L∞ο-equivalence, and countable weakly 2-transitive trees up to isomorphism. Various results are obtained about the automorphism groups, concerning torsion, divisibility, and subgroups of small index. The automorphism groups of some related treelike structures and their normal subgroup lattices are also examined.",
