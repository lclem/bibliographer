	Abstract = {We extend the concept of CDF-series to the context of several variables, and show that the series solution of first-order differential equations yâ€² = x(t, y) and functional equation y = x(t, y), with x CDF in two variables, are CDF-series. We also give many effective closure properties for CDF-series in several variables.},
