	Abstract = {Inductive-inductive types are a joint generalization of mutual inductive types and indexed inductive types. In extensional type theory, inductive-inductive types can be constructed from inductive types, and this construction has been conjectured to work in intensional type theory as well. In this paper, we show that the existing construction requires Uniqueness of Identity Proofs, and present a new construction (which we conjecture generalizes) of one particular inductive-inductive type in cubical type theory, which is compatible with homotopy type theory.},
