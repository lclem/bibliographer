  Abstract      = "We study here some linear recurrence relations in the algebra of square matrices. With the aid of the Cayley--Hamilton Theorem, we derive some explicit formulas for An (n⩾r) and etA for every r×r matrix A, in terms of the coefficients of its characteristic polynomial and matrices Aj, where 0⩽j⩽r−1.",
