	Abstract = {We analyse the solution set of first-order initial value differential problems of the form dydx = Æ’(x, y), y(0) = 0 in the context of combinatorial species in the sense of A. Joyal (Adv. in Math.42 (1981), 1--82). It turns out that the situation is much richer than in the case of formal power series: many non-isomorphic combinatorial solutions are possible for a given problem, although they all have the same underlying generating series. We give many examples of this phenomenon and also elaborate a combinatorial Newton-Raphson iterative scheme for the construction of the solutions. The multidimensional case is treated explicitly.},
