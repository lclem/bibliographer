	Abstract = {Given a ranked alphabet, context are terms with a single occurrence of a special symbol {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}bullet {\}}{\$}{\$}(outside of the alphabet), which represents a missing subterm. One can naturally build equations over contexts: the context variables are treated as symbols of arity one and a substitution S assigns to each such a variable a context S(X). A substitution S is extended to terms with context variables in a natural way: S(X(t)) is a context S(X) in which the unique occurrence of {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}bullet {\}}{\$}{\$}is replaced with S(t). For historical reasons, the satisfiability of context equations is usually referred to as context unification.},
