	abstract = {We initiate a general approach for the fast enumeration of permutations with a prescribed number of occurrences of “forbidden” patterns that seems to indicate that the enumerating sequence is always P-recursive. We illustrate the method completely in terms of the patterns “abc,” “cab,” and “abcd.”},
