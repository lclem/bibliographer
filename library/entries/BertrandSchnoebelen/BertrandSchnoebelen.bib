  Abstract      = {We consider games played on an infinite probabilistic arena where the first player aims at satisfying generalized B\"uchi objectives almost surely, i.e., with probability one. We provide a fixpoint characterization of the winning sets and associated winning strategies in the case where the arena is decisive. From this we directly deduce the decidability of these games on probabilistic lossy channel systems.},
