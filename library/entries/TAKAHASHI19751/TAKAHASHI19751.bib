  Abstract      = {We extend the notion of regular sets of strings to those of trees and of forests in a unified mathematical approach, and investigate their properties. Then by taking certain one-dimensional expressions of these objects, we come to an interesting subclass of CF languages defined over paired alphabets. They are shown to form a Boolean algebra with the Dyck set as the universe, and to play an important role in the whole class of CF languages. In particular, using the subclass we prove a refinement of the well-known Chomsky---Sch{\"u}tzenberger Theorem, and also prove that the decision procedure for parenthesis grammars can be extended to a broader class of CF grammars.},
