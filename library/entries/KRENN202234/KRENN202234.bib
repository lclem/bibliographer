	Abstract = {In this paper we consider a number of natural decision problems involving k-regular sequences. Specifically, they arise from considering*lower and upper bounds on growth rate; in particular boundedness,*images,*regularity (recognizability by a deterministic finite automaton) of preimages, and*factors, such as squares and palindromes, of such sequences. We show that these decision problems are undecidable.},
