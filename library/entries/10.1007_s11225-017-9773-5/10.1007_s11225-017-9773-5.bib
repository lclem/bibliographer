  Abstract      = {We show that arbitrary tautologies of Johansson's minimal propositional logic are provable by "small" polynomial-size dag-like natural deductions in Prawitz's system for minimal propositional logic. These "small" deductions arise from standard "large" tree-like inputs by horizontal dag-like compression that is obtained by merging distinct nodes labeled with identical formulas occurring in horizontal sections of deductions involved. The underlying geometric idea: if the height, $$hleft( partial right) $$h , and the total number of distinct formulas, $$phi left( partial right) $$ , of a given tree-like deduction $$partial $$ of a minimal tautology $$rho $$ are both polynomial in the length of $$rho $$ , $$left| rho right| $$ , then the size of the horizontal dag-like compression $$partial ^{{textsc {c}} }$$ C is at most $$hleft( partial right) times phi left( partial right) $$h , and hence polynomial in $$left| rho right| $$ . That minimal tautologies $$ rho $$ are provable by tree-like natural deductions $$partial $$ with $$left| rho right| $$ -polynomial $$hleft( partial right) $$h and $$phi left( partial right) $$ follows via embedding from Hudelmaier's result that there are analogous sequent calculus deductions of sequent $$Rightarrow rho $$ . The notion of dag-like provability involved is more sophisticated than Prawitz's tree-like one and its complexity is not clear yet. Our approach nevertheless provides a convergent sequence of NP lower approximations of PSPACE-complete validity of minimal logic (Savitch in J Comput Syst Sci 4(2):177---192, 1970); Statman in Theor Comput Sci 9(1):67---72, 1979; Svejdar in Arch Math Log 42(7):711---716, 2003).},
