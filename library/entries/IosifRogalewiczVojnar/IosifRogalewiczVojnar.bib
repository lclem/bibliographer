  Abstract      = "A \emph{data automaton} is a finite automaton equipped with variables (counters or registers) ranging over infinite data domains. A trace of a data automaton is an alternating sequence of alphabet symbols and values taken by the counters during an execution of the automaton. The problem addressed in this paper is the inclusion between the sets of traces (data languages) recognized by such automata. Since the problem is undecidable in general, we give a semi-algorithm based on abstraction refinement, which is proved to be sound and complete, but whose termination is not guaranteed. We have implemented our technique in a\textasciitilde prototype tool and show promising results on several non-trivial examples.",
