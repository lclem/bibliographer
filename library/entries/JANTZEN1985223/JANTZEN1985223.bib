	Abstract = {It is shown that every finite expression which uses the operations union, product, Kleene star, and iterated shuffle in any order, starting with finite sets, defines a language which can be recognized non-deterministically by some multicounter machine in quasirealtime. It is known that this family is in general not closed with respect to iterated shuffle. As a consequence of the characterization each such language is in NSPACE(log n) and thus in P. However, if P â‰  NP, then also neither P nor NSPACE(log n) are closed under iterated shuffle. The proof uses the new concept of so-called shuffle schemes and a number of results on algebraic language theory.},
