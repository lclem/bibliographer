  Abstract      = "The compressed recognition problem consists in checking if an input word w is in a given language L, when we are only given a compressed representation of w. We present several new results related to language recognition problems for compressed texts. These problems are solvable in polynomial time for uncompressed words and some of them become NP-hard for compressed words.",
