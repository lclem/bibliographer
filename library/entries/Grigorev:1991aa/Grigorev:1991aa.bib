	Abstract = {{$[$}We generalize the Newton polygon procedure for algebraic equations to generate solutions of polynomial differential equations of the form ∑∞i=0 αix βi where the αi are complex numbers and the βi are real numbers with {\$}{$\backslash$}beta{\\_}0 > {$\backslash$}beta{\\_}1 > {$\backslash$}cdots{\$}. Using the differential version of the Newton polygon process, we show that any such a series solution is finitely determined and show how one can enumerate all such solutions of a given polynomial differential equation. We also show that the question of deciding if a system of polynomial differential equations has such a power series solution is undecidable.{$]$}},
