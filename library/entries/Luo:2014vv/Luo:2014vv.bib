  Abstract      = "Hybrid automaton is a formal model for precisely describing a hybridsystem in which the computational processes interact with the physicalones. The reachability analysis of the polynomial hybrid automaton isdecidable, which makes the <italic>Taylor</italic> approximation of a hybrid automatonapplicable and valuable. In this paper, we studied the simulation relationamong the hybrid automaton and its Taylor approximation, as well asthe approximate equivalence relation. We also proved that the Taylor approximation simulates its original hybrid automaton, and similar hybridautomata could be compared quantitatively, for example, the approximate equivalence we proposed in the paper.",
