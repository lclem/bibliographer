	Abstract = {We present a tree-based symbolic representation of rhythm notation suitable for processing with purely syntactic theoretical tools such as term rewriting systems or tree automata. Then we propose an equational theory, defined as a set of rewrite rules for transforming these representations. This theory is complete in the sense that from a given rhythm notation the rules permit to generate all notations of equivalent durations.},
