	abstract = {Weighted automata is a basic tool for specification in quantitative verification, which allows to express quantitative features of analysed systems such as resource consumption. Quantitative specification can be assisted by automata learning as there are classic results on Angluin-style learning of weighted automata. The existing work assumes perfect information about the values returned by the target weighted automaton. In assisted synthesis of a quantitative specification, knowledge of the exact values is a strong assumption and may be infeasible. In our work, we address this issue by introducing a new framework of partially-observable deterministic weighted automata, in which weighted automata return intervals containing the computed values of words instead of the exact values. We study the basic properties of this framework with the particular focus on the challenges of active learning partially-observable deterministic weighted automata.},
