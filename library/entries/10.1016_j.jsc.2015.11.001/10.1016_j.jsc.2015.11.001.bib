	Abstract = {We show that Ore operators can be desingularized by calculating a least common left multiple with a random operator of appropriate order, thereby turning a heuristic used for many years in several computer algebra systems into an algorithm. Our result can be viewed as a generalization of a classical result about apparent singularities of linear differential equations.},
