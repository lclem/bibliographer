	Abstract = {We investigate the complexity of satisfiability for one-agent Refinement Modal Logic ({\$}{\backslash}text{\{}{\backslash}sffamily RML{\}}{\$}), a known extension of basic modal logic ({\$}{\backslash}text{\{}{\backslash}sffamily ML{\}}{\$}) obtained by adding refinement quantifiers on structures. It is known that {\$}{\backslash}text{\{}{\backslash}sffamily RML{\}}{\$}has the same expressiveness as {\$}{\backslash}text{\{}{\backslash}sffamily ML{\}}{\$}, but the translation of {\$}{\backslash}text{\{}{\backslash}sffamily RML{\}}{\$}into {\$}{\backslash}text{\{}{\backslash}sffamily ML{\}}{\$}is of non-elementary complexity, and {\$}{\backslash}text{\{}{\backslash}sffamily RML{\}}{\$}is at least doubly exponentially more succinct than {\$}{\backslash}text{\{}{\backslash}sffamily ML{\}}{\$}. In this paper, we show that {\$}{\backslash}text{\{}{\backslash}sffamily RML{\}}{\$}-satisfiability is `only' singly exponentially harder than {\$}{\backslash}text{\{}{\backslash}sffamily ML{\}}{\$}-satisfiability, the latter being a well-known PSPACE-complete problem. More precisely, we establish that {\$}{\backslash}text{\{}{\backslash}sffamily RML{\}}{\$}-satisfiability is complete for the complexity class AEXP{\$}{\\_}{\{}{\backslash}text{\{}{\backslash}sffamily pol{\}}{\}}{\$}, i.e., the class of problems solvable by alternating Turing machines running in single exponential time but only with a polynomial number of alternations (note that NEXPTIME⊆ AEXP{\$}{\\_}{\{}{\backslash}text{\{}{\backslash}sffamily pol{\}}{\}}{\$}⊆ EXPSPACE).},
