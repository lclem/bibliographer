  Abstract      = "Most accounts, including leading textbooks, credit Arthur Norman Prior with the inventing of temporal (tense logic). However, (i) Jerzy {\L}o{\'s} delivered his version of temporal logic in 1947, several years before Prior; (ii) Henrk Hi{\.z}'s review of {\L}o{\'s}'s system in Journal of Symbolic Logic was published as early as 1951; (iii) there is evidence to the effect that, when constructing his tense calculi, Prior was aware of {\L}o{\'s}'s system. Therefore, although Prior is certainly a key figure in the history tense logic, as well as modal logic in general, it should be accepted both in research papers and in teaching that temporal logic was invented by Jerzy {\L}o{\'s}.",
