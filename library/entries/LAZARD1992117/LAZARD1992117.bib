  Abstract      = {It is shown that a good output for a solver of algebraic systems of dimension zero consists of a family of ``triangular sets of polynomials''. Such an output is simple, readable and contains all information which may be wanted. Different algorithms are described for handling triangular systems and obtaining them from Gr{\"o}bner bases. These algorithms are practicable, and most of them are polynomial in the number of solutions.},
