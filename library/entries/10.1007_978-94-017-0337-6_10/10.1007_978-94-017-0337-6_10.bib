  Abstract      = "A division ring, or skew-field, satisfies all the axioms of a field except (possibly) commutativity of multiplication. The center of a division algebra D is a field, which we always denote as F. Thus D is a vector space over F. This paper focuses on the case [D : F] < âˆž; then we call D a division algebra. Division rings arise in several ways:(1)By Schur's lemma, the endomorphism ring of an arbitrary simple module is a division ring.(2)Goldie proved every noncommutative Noetherian domain is Ore, and thus has a classical ring of quotients which is a division ring. This applies for example to enveloping algebras of finite dimensional Lie algebras, and group algebras of torsion-free polycyclic-by-finite groups, rings of differential operators of nonsingular complex algebraic varieties, and other rings of current research interest in mathematics and physics.(3)Many non-Noetherian domains also can be embedded in division rings, e.g. the free ring, and enveloping algebras of arbitrary Lie algebras.(4)By the Wedderburn-Artin theorem, every simple Artinian ring is isomorphic to a matrix ring over a division ring. In particular, any finite dimensional semisimple algebra R can be written as a direct product of matrix rings {\\%} MathType!MTEF!2!1!+-{\\%} feaagCart1ev2aaatCvAUfeBSjuyZL2yd9gzLbvyNv2CaerbuLwBLn{\\%} hiov2DGi1BTfMBaeXatLxBI9gBaerbd9wDYLwzYbItLDharqqtubsr{\\%} 4rNCHbGeaGqiVu0Je9sqqrpepC0xbbL8F4rqqrFfpeea0xe9Lq-Jc9{\\%} vqaqpepm0xbba9pwe9Q8fs0-yqaqpepae9pg0FirpepeKkFr0xfr-x{\\%} fr-xb9adbaqaaeGaciGaaiaabeqaamaabaabaaGcbaGaamytamaaBa{\\%} aaleaacaWG0bGaamyAaaqabaGccaGGOaGaamiramaaBaaaleaacaWG{\\%} PbaabeaakiaacMcacaGGSaaaaa!3CD9!]]</EquationSource><EquationSource Format=``TEX''><![CDATA[{\$}{\$}{\{}M{\\_}{\{}ti{\}}{\}}({\{}D{\\_}i{\}}),{\$}{\$}, for suitable division algebras Di(determined uniquely up to isomorphism).
