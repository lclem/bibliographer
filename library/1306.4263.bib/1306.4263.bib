  abstract      = {We present a Sage implementation of Ore algebras. The main features for the most common instances include basic arithmetic and actions; gcrd and lclm; D-finite closure properties; natural transformations between related algebras; guessing; desingularization; solvers for polynomials, rational functions and (generalized) power series. This paper is a tutorial on how to use the package.},
