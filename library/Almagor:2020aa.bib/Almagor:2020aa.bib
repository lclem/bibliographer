  abstract      = {Orbit Problems are a class of fundamental reachability questions that arise in the analysis of discrete-time linear dynamical systems such as automata, Markov chains, recurrence sequences, and linear while loops. Instances of the problem comprise a dimension d∈ℕ{\$}d{$\backslash$}in {$\backslash$}mathbb {\{}N{\}}{\$}, a square matrix A∈ℚd×d{\$}A{$\backslash$}in {$\backslash$}mathbb {\{}Q{\}}\^{}{\{}d{$\backslash$}times d{\}}{\$}, and a query regarding the behaviour of some sets under repeated applications of A. For instance, in the Semialgebraic Orbit Problem, we are given semialgebraic source and target sets S,T⊆ℝd{\$}S,T{$\backslash$}subseteq {$\backslash$}mathbb {\{}R{\}}\^{}{\{}d{\}}{\$}, and the query is whether there exists n∈ℕ{\$}n{$\backslash$}in {\{}{$\backslash$}mathbb {\{}N{\}}{\}}{\$} and x ∈S such that Anx ∈T. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a unifying formalism for a vast class of orbit problems, and show that this formalism is decidable for dimension d ≤3. Intuitively, our formalism allows one to reason about any first-order query whose atomic propositions are a membership queries of orbit elements in semialgebraic sets. Our decision procedure relies on separation bounds for algebraic numbers as well as a classical result of transcendental number theory---Baker's theorem on linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers. We moreover argue that our main result represents a natural limit to what can be decided (with respect to reachability) about the orbit of a single matrix. On the one hand, semialgebraic sets are arguably the largest general class of subsets of ℝd{\$}{$\backslash$}mathbb {\{}R{\}}\^{}{\{}d{\}}{\$} for which membership is decidable. On the other hand, previous work has shown that in dimension d = 4, giving a decision procedure for the special case of the Orbit Problem with singleton source set S and polytope target set T would entail major breakthroughs in Diophantine approximation.},
