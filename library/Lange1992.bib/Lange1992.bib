  abstract      = {Given m finite automata, the emptiness of intersection problem is to determine whether there exists a string which is accepted by all m automata. In the following we consider the case, when m is bounded by a function in the input length, i.e., in the size and number of the automata. In this way we get complete problems for nondeterministic space-bounded and timespace-bounded complexity classes. Further on, we get close relations to nondeterministic sublinear time classes and to classes which are defined by bounding the number of nondeterministic steps.},
