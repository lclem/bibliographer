  abstract      = {We contribute to the theory of formal languages of visibly multistack pushdown automata (MVPA). First, we show closure under the main operations and decidability of the main decision problems for the class of MVPA restricted to computations where a symbol can be popped out of a stack S only if it was pushed within the last k contexts of S, for a given k (in a context only one stack can be pushed or popped). In particular, this class turns out to be determinizable. Second, we show the closure under complement of the class of languages accepted by ordered MVPA (where the limitation is that a stack can be popped only if all the lower indexed stacks are empty). This gains decidability of universality, inclusion and equivalence for this class. As a further contribution, we compare the classes of languages accepted by different models of MVPA.},
