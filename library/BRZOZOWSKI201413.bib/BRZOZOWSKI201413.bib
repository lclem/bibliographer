  abstract      = {We show that every regular language defines a unique nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), which we call ``{\'a}tomaton'', whose states are the ``atoms'' of the language, that is, non-empty intersections of complemented or uncomplemented left quotients of the language. We describe methods of constructing the {\'a}tomaton, and prove that it is isomorphic to the reverse automaton of the minimal deterministic finite automaton (DFA) of the reverse language. We study ``atomic'' NFAs in which the right language of every state is a union of atoms. We generalize Brzozowski's double-reversal method for minimizing a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), showing that the result of applying the subset construction to an NFA is a minimal DFA if and only if the reverse of the NFA is atomic. We prove that Sengoku's claim that his method always finds a minimal NFA is false.},
