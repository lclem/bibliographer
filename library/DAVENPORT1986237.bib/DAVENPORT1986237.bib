  abstract      = {Let L(y) = b be a linear differential equation with coefficients in a differential field k, of characteristic 0, We show that if L(y) = b has a non-zero solution Liouvillian over k, then either L(y) = 0 has a non-zero solution u such that u'/u is algebraic over k, or L(y) = b has a solution in k. If L(y) = b has a non-zero solution elementary over k, then either L(y) = 0 has a non-zero solution algebraic over k, or L(y) = b has a solution in k. This latter fact is a consequence of the fact that if L(y) = b has a solution elementary over k, then it has a solution of the form P(log u1,..., log um), where P is a polynomial with coefficients algebraic over k whose degree is at most equal to the order of L(y), and the u; are algebraic over k. Algorithmic considerations are also discussed.},
