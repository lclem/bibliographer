  abstract      = {Best-first search is a general heuristic search algorithm that always expands next a frontier node of lowest cost. It includes as special cases breadth-first search, Dijkstra's single-source shortest-path algorithm, and the Aâˆ— algorithm. Its applicability, however, is limited by its exponential memory requirement. Previous approaches to this problem, such as iterative deepening, do not expand nodes in best-first order if the cost function can decrease along a path. We present a linear-space best-first search algorithm (RBFS) that always explores new nodes in best-first order, regardless of the cost function, and expands fewer nodes than iterative deepening with a nondecreasing cost function. On the sliding-tile puzzles, \{RBFS\} with a nonmonotonic weighted evaluation function dramatically reduces computation time with only a small penalty in solution cost. In general, \{RBFS\} reduces the space complexity of best-first search from exponential to linear, at the cost of only a constant factor in time complexity in our experiments. },
