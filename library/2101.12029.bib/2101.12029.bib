  abstract      = {We introduce a novel amortised resource analysis couched in a type-and-effect system. Our analysis is formulated in terms of the physicist's method of amortised analysis, and is potential-based. The type system makes use of logarithmic potential functions and is the first such system to exhibit *logarithmic amortised complexity*. With our approach we target the automated analysis of self-adjusting data structures, like splay trees, which so far have only manually been analysed in the literature. In particular, we have implemented a semi-automated prototype, which successfully analyses the zig-zig case of *splaying*, once the type annotations are fixed.},
