  abstract      = {Sampled semantics of timed automata is a finite approximation of their dense time behavior. While the former is closer to the actual software or hardware systems with a fixed granularity of time, the abstract character of the latter makes it appealing for system modeling and verification. We study one aspect of the relation between these two semantics, namely checking whether the system exhibits some qualitative (untimed) behaviors in the dense time which cannot be reproduced by any implementation with a fixed sampling rate. More formally, the \emph{sampling problem} is to decide whether there is a sampling rate such that all qualitative behaviors (the untimed language) accepted by a given timed automaton in dense time semantics can be also accepted in sampled semantics. We show that this problem is decidable.},
