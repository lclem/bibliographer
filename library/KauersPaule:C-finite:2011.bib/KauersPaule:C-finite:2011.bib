  abstract      = {Polynomial sequences obey certain linear recurrence equations with constant coefficients, as we have seen in the previous chapter. But in general, a sequence satisfying a linear recurrence equation with constant coefficients need not be a polynomial sequence. The solutions to such recurrence equations form a strictly larger class of sequences, the so-called C-finite sequences. This is the class we consider now.},
